Inflation and Money

Chapter 9 , 14

Money

Money is an asset that people use to make and receive payments when buying and selling goods and services.

Money serves three functions in a modern economy:

It is a medium of exchange.

It is a store of value.

It is a unit of account (measure of worth).

Money

A medium of exchange is an asset that can be traded for goods and services.

Money

A store of value is an asset that enables people to transfer purchasing power into the future.

Money

A unit of account is a universal yardstick that is used to express relative prices of goods and services.

Money

The U.S. dollar, HK dollar and other national currencies are examples of fiat money.

Fiat money : an asset that is used as legal tender by government decree and is not backed by a physical commodity like gold.

If you are in an isolated island where no one accepts US$ for transaction, does US$ have value to you?

When an unknown identity “Satoshi Nakamoto” created Bitcoin (not fiat money), why does Bitcoin have value?



On 8 November 2016 (8:15pm), the Government of India announced some of the most commonly used money at that time, ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series, would be invalid past that midnight. The old money can be deposited with banks until 30 December 2016. 

When Indian government announced “the cancelled ₹500 and ₹1000 notes are no longer exchangeable at any bank in India”, do those cancelled Indian rupee banknotes still have value?

Fiat money, such as U.S. dollar and HK dollar, has no  intrinsic value. 

U.S. dollar has market value because a government maintains its value, and/or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.

Who is responsible for controlling the supply of USD?

The Federal Reserve System, the Fed, is the central bank of the United States.

A central bank is the public authority that regulates a nation’s depository institutions and controls the quantity of money. 

The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It performs five general functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and, more generally, the public interest. The Federal Reserve

conducts the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices in the U.S. economy; 

promotes the stability of the financial system and seeks to minimize and contain systemic risks through active monitoring and engagement in the U.S. and abroad; 

promotes the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and monitors their impact on the financial system as a whole; 

fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency through services to the banking industry and the U.S. government that facilitate U.S.-dollar transactions and payments; and 

promotes consumer protection and community development through consumer-focused supervision and examination, research and analysis of emerging consumer issues and trends, community economic development activities, and the administration of consumer laws and regulations.

Money

The price level of a country in the long run can be viewed as the purchasing power of its currency.

A persistently decrease in the purchasing power of money is inflation.

A persistently increase in the purchasing power of money is deflation.



Inflation rate is the percentage change in the overall price level, or the percentage change in the purchasing power of money.

What causes hyperinflation?

Velocity of money

The average number of times per year that each piece of paper currency is used in a transaction

How fast each paper currency change hands

V always assumed to be constant in the long run, so V=k which k is a positive constant.

The Quantity theory of money

Long Run

Practice Question

Express the quantity equation in terms of growth rates



The growth rate of a constant is ZERO



Conventionally, inflation rate is denoted by π

Questions:

what causes inflation in the long run?

Money grows faster than real production

what causes deflation in the long run?

Real production grows faster than money



Quantity Theory of Money predicts, in the long run, the changes in the growth rate of money lead one-for-one to changes in the inflation rate 

Empirically, this holds up both in United States and worldwide data.



Practice Question

Imagine that the chairperson of the Federal Reserve announced that, as of the following day, all currency in circulation in the United States would be worth 10 times its face denomination. For example, a $10 bill would be worth $100; a $100 bill would be worth $1,000, etc. 

Furthermore, the balance in all checking and savings accounts is to be multiplied by 10 as will the balance of all outstanding debts. So, if you have $500 in your checking account, as of the following day, your balance would be $5,000, etc. 



Would you actually be 10 times better off on the day the announcement took effect?

Is issuing new money always a good way to achieve the economic growth and better welfare?



Money

In a hypothetical frictionless market, the neutrality of money says that changes in the money supply, in the long run, 

does not affect real economic variables

only affect nominal variable, such as money prices



Empirically

Holds in the long run 

Does not hold in the short run 

nominal prices do not respond immediately to changes in the money supply 

Other frictions

Ignore pollical views in this video and focus on the economic aspects.

Questions: What can government do if  the sources of funds cannot cover the uses?

The government budget constraint



Spend less?



Borrow more?

If a government runs large budget deficits, as debt rises, lenders may worry the government will have trouble paying back loans

They may stop lending to the government altogether 



Rise taxes?

May not be politically feasible



Print more money?

The government may resort to printing currency to finance its budget

Lenders to the government will be paid back in currency that is worth less than the dollars lent



Seigniorage, or Inflation tax is the profit made by a government by issuing more money (ΔM), especially the difference between the face value of coins and their production costs.

The Fiscal Causes of High Inflation

Costs of Hyperinflation

If somehow you are expecting a high inflation of HK$ in the near future, what would you do?

What is the potential consequence for HK$ in the short run?

If many people believe there will be a high inflation of HK$, what would happen?

Hyperinflation causes misallocation of resources (inefficiency)



Costs of Hyperinflation

Read textbook and/or attend tutorials for more explanation.



Large surprise inflations can lead to large distributions in wealth.

People with debts can pay back their loans with new cheaper dollars.

Creditors wind up losers.

Taxes

Based on nominal incomes 

Tax distortions are more severe when inflation is high

Economic decisions

Based on real variables

Inflation also distorts relative prices

Some prices are faster at adjusting to inflation than other prices.

Shoe leather costs of inflation

People want to hold less money when inflation is high.

Menu costs

The costs to firms of changing prices frequently.

And more.

Money Supply

The money supply is the total amount of money—cash, coins, and balances in bank accounts—in circulation.

The money supply is commonly defined to be a group of safe assets that households and businesses can use to make payments or to hold as short-term investments. 

For example, U.S. currency and balances held in checking accounts and savings accounts are included in many measures of the money supply.

There are several standard measures of the money supply, including the monetary base, M1, and M2.

The monetary base: the sum of currency in circulation and reserve balances (deposits held by banks and other depository institutions in their accounts at the Federal Reserve).

M1: the sum of currency held by the public and transaction deposits at depository institutions (which are financial institutions that obtain their funds mainly through deposits from the public, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks, and credit unions).

M2: M1 plus savings deposits, small-denomination time deposits (those issued in amounts of less than $100,000), and retail money market mutual fund shares.

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)

A CBDC is a digital form of central bank money that is widely available to the general public.

"Central bank money" refers to money that is a liability of the central bank. In the United States, there are currently two types of central bank money: physical currency issued by the Federal Reserve and digital balances held by commercial banks at the Federal Reserve.
