Note: 

If the lecture content differs from the textbook content, please refer to the lecture material.

Funds can come from three major sources:

Private saving

mostly households

Public saving

government budget surplus 

Government receipt= tax revenue

Government outlays = government purchases + transfers

Government outlays of the U.S. = government purchases + transfers + debt interest (not required for the exam)

Government budget surplus:  receipt > outlays

Borrowing from the rest of the world 

Trade deficit contributes to the credit supplied by foreigners.

Trade deficit: imports > exports







Since the early 1980s, except for 1991, the United States has been a net borrower from the rest of the world.

Trade deficit contributes to the credit supplied by foreigners.

Banks

Commercial banks borrow from savers in one market and lend to borrowers in another market. 

Banks play the role of “middlemen”.

Commercial banks borrow from savers at a lower rate and then lend to borrowers at a higher rate to make profits. 

Commercial banks also provide services including 

risk sharing

liquidity

information

Banks

Commercial banks and financial intermediaries are the organizations that connect savers and borrowers.

The loanable funds market improves the allocation of resources in an economy by enabling savers to lend their excess money to borrowers.

Future consumption



If the real interest rate were to increase, would you be inclined to save more or less?

Loanable Funds Market

Question: if the real interest rate were to increase, would you be inclined to save more or less?



Effect 1: A higher real interest rate implies a higher return to savings. You would save more!

Effect 2: A higher real interest rate implies that you can save less to generate a retirement nest egg of a certain size. You would therefore save less!



In aggregate, effect 2 is weaker than effect 1, meaning that higher real interest rate increases the amount of money that households save.



Loanable funds (or credit) supply schedule 

A table that reports the quantity of loanable funds (or credit) supplied at different real interest rates, holding all else equal.

Loanable funds (or credit) supply curve 

A curve that plots the quantity of loanable funds (or credit) supplied at different real interest rates.

Government policies

Practice Question

In a competitive loanable funds market in the U.S., what would occur if:



With positive news about the economy, firms become optimistic about their business prospects and opt to secure more loans to expand, preparing for a future economic boom.

As a result of improved economic conditions, firms pay more dividends and retain less earnings for saving.

Banks start exercising caution and only lend to individuals with excellent credit history.

Due to the pandemic, households become anxious about their future income resources and begin to save more.

Assume that the Chinese government discontinues lending money to the U.S. loanable funds market due to government tensions.

Households start buying more houses.



Loanable Funds Market

Financial markets are highly volatile in the short run but remarkably stable in the long run. 

Volatility comes from fluctuations in either the demand for credit or the supply of credit.

These fluctuations bring fluctuations in the real interest rate and in the equilibrium quantity of funds lent and borrowed. 

They also bring fluctuations in asset prices.



International Loanable Funds Market

A country that is borrowing more from the rest of the world than it is lending to it is called an international net borrower.

A country that is lending more to the rest of the world than it is borrowing from it is called an international net lender.

International Loanable Funds Market

Assume a free and competitive global loanable funds market and disregard currency exchange. If the U.S. real interest rate is higher than that of the rest of the world, then what would you do

as a U.S. lender

as a U.S. borrower

as an international lender

as an international borrower

Would the U.S. be an international net borrower or lender?

international net borrower



Assume a free and competitive global loanable funds market and disregard currency exchange. 

Lenders want to earn the highest possible real interest rate and they will seek it by looking around the world.

Borrowers want to pay the lowest possible real interest rate and they will seek it by looking around the world.

When financial capital is mobile and frictionless: it moves to the best advantage of lenders and borrowers.

Credit flows into the country in which the real interest rate is highest and out of the country in which the real interest rate is lowest.

Since the early 1980s, except for 1991, the United States has been a net borrower from the rest of the world.
