1. Production model
1.1. The production function f1 makes better sense because it follows the
Cobb-Douglas production function format. It assumes that output increases with
increasing capital and labor but at a decreasing rate due to the law of diminishing
MPL and MPK. The exponents represent the output elasticities of capital and
labor, respectively.

■ 𝑤 =

or w = MPL

The first order conditions’s economic intuition is that firms will invest capital and
hire labor up until the marginal product of each input equals to its price, achieving
equilibrium.
Market clearing conditions:
Supply of capital = Demand for capital
𝑠 𝑑
𝐾 = 𝐾
Supply of labor = demand for labor

1.7. The graph output is much greater relatively with the same input compared to A=1
because the function is being multiplied by the TFP of 10. This indicates that a
higher TFP causes a permanently higher eonomic growth.
1.8.
■ A larger labor force: In the long term, the effects of a larger labor force on
growth will diminish due to the law of diminishing MPL according to the
Cobb-Douglas production function.
■ Capital stock accumulation: Similar to labor, the effects of a larger labor
force on growth will diminish due to the law of diminishing MPK according
to the Cobb-Douglas production function.
■ A permanently higher saving rate: Because a permanently higher saving
rate will lead to a higher amount of investment, and therefore a higher
amount of capital, it will be subject to diminishing returns to capital
(diminishing MPK), so the effect of a permanently higher saving rate will
also decrease and eventually.
■ A permanently better TFP: Improvements in TFP, such as technological
progress will have an impact long-term on sustained economic growth
due to there not being a diminishing return on TFP.

2. Production Function Curve
2.1 E->B
Variables Change Explain
TFP A A Because point B’s Y/N is higher, and K/N stays the
same, from Y/N=ĀK^1/3N^-1/3, we can conclude
that Ā must also be greater.
Real Output Y A As seen in the graph, B has a higher y value(Y/N)
than E, and an equal x value(K/N), because both
axes share the same denominator, it can be
concluded that B has a higher Y value.
Per worker real output Y/N A As seen in the graph, B has a higher y value(Y/N)
than E
MPK A As MPK is Y’s derivative with respect to K, thence

value and both K value is the same, B will have a
higher MPK value

( 1/3)
2 𝐾
𝑀𝑃𝐿 = Ā , because point B has a higher Ā

value and both K value is the same, B will have a
higher MPL value.
2.2 E->F
Variables Change Explain
TFP A C Both points have equal Ā, only changing N and K
values value since they are of the same function.
Y D Although both (Y/N) and (K/N) of F is greater, we
don’t the cause if it is because Y is greater or N is
lower.
Per worker real output Y/N A As seen in the graph, B has a higher y value(Y/N)
than F
MPK B As MPK is Y’s derivative with respect to K, thence

( 2/3)

𝑀𝑃𝐾 = Ā , because point F has a higher 𝐾

value and the same A value, F will have a lower
MPK value.
MPL A As MPL is Y’s derivative with respect to K, thence
( 1/3)
2 𝐾
𝑀𝑃𝐿 = Ā , because point F has a higher
3 𝑁1/3
Y/N and K/N, either K is increasing or N is
decreasing, both will result in a higher MPL value.
2.3 E->G
Variables Change Explain
TFP A A Because point B’s Y/N is higher, and K/N stays the
same, from Y/N=ĀK^1/3N^-1/3, we can conclude
that Ā must also be greater.
Real Output Y A Because both (Y/N) and (K/N) of F is greater, y
must be increasing at a rate that keeps its ratio with
N increasing. This is because if y were constant or
decreasing, the ratio y/n would not increase.
Per worker real output Y/N A Because point G’s Y/N is higher, and K/N stays the
same, from Y/N^(2/3)=ĀK^1/3, we can conclude
that Ā must also be greater.
MPK D As MPK is Y’s derivative with respect to K, thence
( 2/3)
1 𝑁
𝑀𝑃𝐾 = Ā , because point G has a higher 𝐾
3 𝐾2/3
and Ā value, its MPK cannot be determined as the
exact values of Ā and K are not known.
MPL A As MPL is Y’s derivative with respect to K, thence
( 1/3)
2 𝐾
𝑀𝑃𝐿 = Ā , because point G has a higher A,
3 𝑁1/3
Y/N and K/N, either A is increasing and K is
increasing or N is decreasing, this will result in a
higher MPL value.

4. Fiscal Multiplier
4.1
The fiscal multiplier = 1/(1 - 0.75 * (1 - 0.2)) = 2.5
4.2
The expected overall impact on GDP would be $10 trillion * 2.5 = $25 trillion
4.3
Encouraging household saving during a recession can have both positive and negative
effects on the economy. On the positive side, increased savings can lead to increased
investment, which can stimulate economic growth in the long run. On the negative side,
in the short run, increased savings may lead to decreased consumption, which can
further deepen the recession.
But overall in a recession, as the paradox of thrift states, if people save more,
consumption decreases, and incomes decrease, so consumption decreases, and so on.
The problem we need to fix during a recesion is lack of demand and not investment,
hence polices that boost spending such as cutting taxes and subsided for businesses,
are more favorable in combating a recession, because we first must stimulate the
economy by increasing demand, which will then encourage businesses to hire more
workers, which will then lead to more income and more spending, and start this circular
flow to pull the economy out of recession.

5.4
According to the long-run Philips curve, the unemployment rate, in the long run, will have no
trade-off with the inflation rate, this suggests that in the long run the economy will always return
to its potential output regardless of the inflation rate because in the long run the natural
unemployment rate will become the actual unemployment rate and the economy will be able to
produce its potential output.
