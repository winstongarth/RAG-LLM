Countercyclical Policy

Fiscal policy

In the United States, fiscal policy is directed by both the executive and legislative branches of the government. In the executive branch, the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, often with economic advisers' counsel, direct fiscal policies.

Monetary policy

Managed by the central bank, the Fed



The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States. It performs five general functions to promote the effective operation of the U.S. economy and, more generally, the public interest. The Federal Reserve

conducts the nation’s monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices in the U.S. economy; 

promotes the stability of the financial system and seeks to minimize and contain systemic risks through active monitoring and engagement in the U.S. and abroad; 

promotes the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and monitors their impact on the financial system as a whole; 

fosters payment and settlement system safety and efficiency through services to the banking industry and the U.S. government that facilitate U.S.-dollar transactions and payments; and 

promotes consumer protection and community development through consumer-focused supervision and examination, research and analysis of emerging consumer issues and trends, community economic development activities, and the administration of consumer laws and regulations.

Dual Mandate

Chair Powell

“My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. ”

“Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. ”

“My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.”

Dual Mandate

Chair Powell

“Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. ”

“The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. ”



“As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. ”



“The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. ”

Practice Questions

Suppose the Federal Reserve sets the required reserve ratio at 5% for all banks, regardless of their size. 

Find the theoretical money multiplier.

If the Fed increases the monetary base by $1 billion, what would be the maximum potential change in the total amount of money?

Suggest one possible reason for the actual money multiplier being smaller than the theoretical one.

If the primary concern of the economy is low employment and output, would you recommend a higher or lower required reserve ratio? 

If the primary concern of the economy is the stability of the financial system, would you suggest a higher or lower required reserve ratio?

Monetary System

Why banks need reserves?

To meet depositors’ currency withdrawals, and 

to make payments to other banks.

What if depositors lost confidence in a bank, and tried to withdraw their money all at once? 

A bank run

A bank run occurs when many clients withdraw their money from a bank, because they believe the bank may fail in the near future.

Open Market Operation

Interbank loans: a bank with excess reserve, which is often referred to as liquidity, might lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. 

Banks can choose to hold excess reserves: reserves held by a bank in excess of the amount that is legally required by the central bank.

Liquidity

Liquid assets: the assets can be sold and instantly converted into cash with comparatively little risk of loss. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp

These assets are typically short-term in nature and provide banks with the ability to meet their immediate liquidity needs. Examples of liquid assets include cash, reserves held at the central bank, and short-term government securities.

The Federal Funds Rate (FFR) is the interest rate that banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight.





Open Market Operation

FFR is the interest rate that banks borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight. 

determined by the market 

the rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks

Influence by monetary policy conducted by the Fed

The FFR is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market and and central to the conduct of monetary policy in the U.S. as it influences a wide range of market interest rates.

It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings.

Additionally, it indirectly influences longer-term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.

The primary tool of monetary policy is the Fed’s control of the FFR

Through open market operations: the purchase or sale of Treasury securities by the Fed. 





Fed Functions: Conducting Monetary Policy

Simplified story:

Equilibrium in the market for reserves determines the actual federal funds rate.

By using open market operations, the Fed adjusts the supply of reserves to keep the federal funds rate on target

Open Market Operations

The FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.

If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, then
