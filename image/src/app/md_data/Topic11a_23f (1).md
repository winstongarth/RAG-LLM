Countercyclical Policy

Chapter 14-16

Countercyclical Policy

Expansionary policy 

aims to reduce the severity of an economic recession 

It is meant to “heat up” the economy and economic activity.

Contractionary policy 

is used to slow down the economy when it grows too fast, or “overheated.”





Countercyclical Policy

Question: Why would policymakers want to slow down the economy?

Moderate business cycle

Ease inflation pressure

A contractionary policy can reduce the risks of an extreme contraction by trying to cool off the economy before it overheats.

“I’m the fellow who takes away the punch bowl just when the party is getting good.”

Former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin, Jr.







Countercyclical Policy

Fiscal policy

In the United States, fiscal policy is directed by both the executive and legislative branches of the government. In the executive branch, the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, often with economic advisers' counsel, direct fiscal policies.

Monetary policy

Managed by the central bank, the Fed



The Federal Reserve System (the Fed) is the central bank of the United States.

A central bank is the public authority that regulates a nation’s depository institutions and controls the quantity of money.



The Fed sets U.S. monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices in the U.S. economy.

Dual mandate

price stability 

maximum sustainable employment



Fiscal Policy

The federal budget is the annual statement of the federal government’s outlays and tax revenues.

The federal budget has two purposes:

To finance federal government programs and activities

To achieve macroeconomic objectives



Fiscal policy is the use of the federal budget (setting and changing taxes, making transfer payments, and purchasing goods and services) to achieve macroeconomic objectives

include aggregate demand for goods and services, employment, inflation, and economic growth

US Office of Management and Budget. (March 28, 2023). Total receipts and outlays of the U.S. federal budget from fiscal years 2000 to 2028 (in trillion U.S. dollars) [Graph]. In Statista.

Practice Questions

Assume constant expected inflation. 

If the government chooses to increase transfer payments to households,

would this be considered expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy?

Starting from a below full-employment equilibrium, use the AS-AD model to illustrate the short-run and long-run effects of this one-time policy.

If the government is concerned about inflation,

suggest one fiscal policy that could assist in addressing the issue of high inflation.

Starting from an above full-employment equilibrium, use the AS-AD model to illustrate the short-run and long-run effects of the one-time policy you suggested.





According to John Maynard Keynes, during a recession, governments should increase their spending on public works programs, such as building infrastructure, to create jobs and generate income for the people. Keynes proposed this idea to stimulate the economy and argued that the increased spending would help to stimulate demand and get the economy moving again.

Can expansionary fiscal policy affect the potential Real GDP?

Depends

If governments hire someone to dig a hole and then fill it up again

If governments build infrastructure such as schools and research centers that help with total R&D











not affect potential RGDP

increase potential RGDP

What Is Crowding Out?

Recessions and the Components of AD—part 1

We can understand the 2007-2009 recession better by examining what happened to the components of real GDP.

(The red bar indicates the period of the recession, per the NBER).



Consumption spending fell, relative to potential GDP during the recession.

This was unusual: consumption usually stays steady during a recession.

Consumption also stayed low in the four post-recession years.

Recessions and the Components of AD—part 2

Residential investment had been falling before the recession, and continued to fall during it.

Spending on residential investment has continued to be below the pre-recession boom levels.

Recessions and the Components of AD—part 3

Net exports increased (became less negative) just before and during the recession.

This was in part due to the falling value of the $US.

After the recession, net exports started to decrease once more, but then have stayed relatively steady.

Loose monetary policy has kept the value of  the $US down.
