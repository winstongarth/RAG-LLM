Multiplier

Chapter 12

Consumption

Consumption tends to follow a relatively smooth, upward trend; its growth declines during periods of recession.

How strong is the relationship between income and consumption?

A straight line describes this relationship very well, suggesting that households spend a consistent fraction of each extra dollar of real disposable income on consumption.

Consumption

Practice Questions

If people spend $0.6 out of each additional dollar they earned after tax, how much they save out of each additional dollar they earned? 

Then, what is the slope of the saving function?

Consumption

The Multiplier

When autonomous expenditure changes, so does equilibrium expenditure and real GDP.

But the change in equilibrium expenditure is larger than the change in autonomous expenditure (investment, government spending, and exports).

The multiplier is the amount by which a change in autonomous expenditure is magnified or multiplied to determine the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP.

Government purchases have generally, though not consistently, increased over time; exceptions include the early 1990s (end of cold war) and due to state and local cutbacks after 2009.

Simplifying Assumptions

No leakage of the income 



The MPC determines the magnitude of the amount of induced expenditure at each round as aggregate expenditure moves toward equilibrium expenditure.

The multiplier can work in reverse too, like it did during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Several events, including the stock market crash of October 1929, led to reductions in investments by firms.

Real GDP fell, so consumers cut back on spending, prompting firms to reduce production more, so consumers spent even less…

Recovery from the Great Depression took many years; unemployment remained above 10% until the U.S. entered World War II in 1941

The Paradox of Thrift

Recall the savings identity: savings equals investment.

This implied that savings were the key to long-term growth.

But consider what happens in the short-term if people save more: consumption decreases, and incomes decrease, so consumption decreases more… potentially pushing the economy into recession.

John Maynard Keynes referred to this as the paradox of thrift: what appears to be favorable in the long-run may be counterproductive in the short-run.

Economists debate whether this paradox of thrift really exists; increasing savings decreases the real interest rate; the consequent increase in investment spending may offset the decrease in consumption spending.

This is a real-world data-driven debate, unable to be settled by our simple model.

Determinants of Consumption

What affects the level of consumption?

Current disposable income

Consumer expenditure is largely determined by how much money consumers receive in a given year. We measure this by personal income, minus personal income taxes, plus government transfer payments such as Social Security.

Income expands most years; hence so does consumption.

Household wealth

A household’s wealth can be thought of as its assets (like homes, stocks and bonds, and bank accounts) minus its liabilities (mortgages, student loans, etc.).

Households with greater wealth will spend more on consumption, even with similar incomes. Recent studies estimate that an extra $1,000 in wealth will result in $40-$50 in extra annual consumption spending, holding constant the effect of income.



Determinants of Consumption

Expected future income

Most people prefer to keep their consumption fairly stable from year to year, a process known as consumption-smoothing.

Example: Salespeople working on commission might have high incomes in some years, and low incomes in others. In order to predict their consumption, we would need to know what they believed their income would be in the future.

The price level

As prices rise, household wealth may fall or rise. If you have $100,000 in the bank, that will buy fewer products at higher prices. Consequently, higher prices result in lower consumption spending.

The interest rate

Higher real interest rates encourage saving rather than spending; so they result in lower spending, especially on durable goods.
