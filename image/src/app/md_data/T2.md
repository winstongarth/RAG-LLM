LABOR FORCE
Employed: someone who currently has a job or who is temporarily away from
his or her job.
Unemployed: someone who is not currently at work but who is available
for work and who has actively looked for work during the previous month.
Labor force: The sum of employed and unemployed workers in the economy.
Unemployment rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
Discouraged workers: People who are available for work but have not looked
for a job during the previous four weeks because they believe no jobs are
available for them.

TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Frictional unemployment:
short-term unemployment occurs when individuals are temporarily without a job
while transitioning from one position to another or entering the workforce for the
first time.
It's a natural form of unemployment that results from the time it takes for job-
seekers to find a match for their skills and preferences.
Some maybe due to seasonal factor
Seasonal unemployment
Example: A recent college graduate who is actively looking for her first job is
experiencing frictional unemployment.
10

TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Structural unemployment
a persistent mismatch between the skills that workers in the economy can
offer, and the skills demanded by employers. This mismatch could be due
to technological changes, globalization, or other structural factors.
Example: A factory worker who loses his job due to automation and has
difficulty finding new employment because his skills are not in demand is
experiencing structural unemployment.
11

TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT
Cyclical unemployment
Occurs due to downturns in the economy. During economic recessions or
depressions, demand for goods and services falls, leading to job losses as
companies cut back on production.
Example: During the 2008 financial crisis, many individuals lost their jobs due to a
severe economic downturn, reflecting cyclical unemployment.
12

FULL EMPLOYMENT
occurs in the macro economy when cyclical unemployment is zero
Also known as natural rate of unemployment and is the sum of frictional
unemployment and strutural unemployment
frictional unemployment will never be zero
structural unemployment will never be zero
Full employment aims to achieve a balance where the level of employment is high, but not so
high that it triggers inflation due to over-demand for goods and services.
13

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI)
The Consumer Price Index tracks the market value of a particular basket of goods and
services over time
•A base period is selected
•The basket of goods and services is the one that is purchased by a typical household,
and it is constructed in the base period
•The index at the base year is normalized at 100
CPI of current year=

LIMITATIONS OF CPI
Four biases cause changes
in the CPI to overstate the true inflation rate:
Substitution bias
Consumers tend to substitute towards goods that have become relatively less expensive. However, the CPI is based on a fixed
basket of goods, and does not account for this substitution, leading to an overestimation of the cost of living.
Increase in quality bias
Over time, the quality of goods and services tends to improve. The CPI might interpret these quality improvements as an
increase in the cost of living, thus overstating inflation.
New product bias
The introduction of new goods provides consumers with more choices, and can also lead to a higher standard of living.
The CPI is slow to incorporate these new goods, which can overstate inflation.
Outlet bias
Consumers might change where they shop based on prices. If consumers switch to buying from cheaper outlets or
online, the CPI, which does not account for outlet substitution, might overstate inflation.

COST OF INFLATION
Anticipated inflation:
Redistribution of income
Decrease in purchasing power by holding paper money
Menu cost to some firm
Uncertainty
Bracket Creep
Interest Rate Costs
Unanticipated inflation: benefits the borrowers while the lenders worse off.
Unanticipated deflation: benefits the lenders while the borrowers worse off.
