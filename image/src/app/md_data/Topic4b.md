Unemployment and Labor market

Chapter 9 



Simplifying Assumptions

Assume price level, or the purchasing power of money, is constant.

money wage = real wage

The aggregate labor market is perfectly competitive. 

All workers have the same skill level

No market participant has significant market power

Participants take wage as given

Assume the working hours per day per worker is constant and is the same for all workers.

Labor Market

The demand for labor is determined by firms that want to maximize profits. 

The supply of labor is determined by workers who want to maximize utility. 



The perfectly competitive labor market is where the equilibrium real wage and aggregate quantity of labor are determined.

Real wage rate: inflation adjusted wage rate







The Supply for Labor

The supply of labor is determined by workers who want to maximize utility. 

The benefit or satisfaction of households is called utility.

How do you gain utilities?

The Supply for Labor

Households face limited time (24 hours per day) and need to determine how to allocate limited time between working and leisure (not working).



How to solve optimization problem:

Should you work one more hour?

Compare marginal benefits to marginal cost.





Marginal benefit

Marginal cost

The Supply for Labor

Should you work one more hour?

What is the MC of working?

MC = utilities you could have from not work (leisure)

What is the MB of working?

MB = utilities you gain from one hour wage

               + utility from working one more hour (if any ) 

Compare marginal benefits to marginal cost



Therefore, on average, higher the real wage, ____________ the quantity supplied of labor.

Labor Market

The demand for labor is determined by firms that want to maximize profits. 

The supply of labor is determined by workers who want to maximize utility. 



The perfectly competitive labor market is where the equilibrium real wage and aggregate quantity of labor are determined.

Real wage rate: inflation adjusted wage rate







Why do firms hire labor?





The Demand for Labor

Firms need to hire production factors: labor, capital, land and entrepreneurship, to produce goods and services.

The demand for labor is determined by firms that want to maximize profits. 





The Demand for Labor

Firms seek to maximize profits.  

A firm will hire that unit of production factor as long as the additional (marginal) benefit is greater than or equal to the additional (marginal) cost.





Marginal benefit

 ≥



Marginal cost

The Demand for Labor

Question: Assume a firm, Wisconsin Cheeseman, produces cheese box. It has a fixed amount of capital inputs and focuses on determining the optimal units of labor to hire.

What is the marginal cost of hiring one more worker?

MC = money wage for that worker

What is the marginal benefit of hiring one more worker?

MB = VMPL

Value of marginal product (VMPL) of labor is the contribution of an additional worker to a firm’s revenue.

VMPL = Marginal Product of Labor x Output Price

The Demand for Labor Derived

Production Data for The Wisconsin Cheeseman

This Cheeseman is tasked with choosing how much output to generate per day and how many labor hours to hire to produce that level of output. 

Assume the working hours per day per worker is constant, and the amount of machines owned by Cheeseman are fixed.



Cheeseman is a price taker in cheese market and labor market. The price of each cheese box is $2.

The Demand for Labor Derived

The Demand for Labor

As the price of labor goes up the quantity demanded decreases

Appendix

 Substitution Effect and Income Effect for the Supply for Labor







 Helpful but not required for the exam

The law of diminishing MRS (marginal rate of substitution between leisure and work/consumption)

Substitution Effect and Income Effect for the Supply for Labor

Substitution Effect and Income Effect for the Supply for Labor

Substitution Effect and Income Effect for the Supply for Labor

A higher wage rate 

→ leisure is more expensive 

→ less leisure  work more

Substitution effect

→ income is higher 

→ more leisure (assuming leisure is a normal good)  work less

Income effect

For average households

Substitution effect > Income effect

↑ real wage → work ↑
