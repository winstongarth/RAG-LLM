Inflation

The price level is the average level of prices.

A persistently rising price level is called inflation.

A persistently falling price level is called deflation.



We are interested in the price level because we want to

Measure the inflation rate or the deflation rate

Distinguish between money values and real values of economic variables.

Used by policy makers to analyze the economy. For example:

escalate Social Security and other federal payments

adjust tax brackets, to deflate other time series data, and to convert nominal dollars to real dollars. 

Used by businesses and private citizens

adjust wages 

escalate rents and other payments.

Inflation

Two price indexes used to measure overall changes in the price level and inflation:

GDP Deflator

It is a measure of how prices of goods and services produced in a country have changed since the base year.

Consumer Price Index, CPI

It is a measure of how prices of goods and services consumed in a country have changed since the base year.



Inflation

GDP Deflator: the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP.  

It is a measure of how prices of goods and services produced in a country have changed since the base year.



CPI

Consumer Price Index, or CPI 

It is a measure of how prices of goods and services consumed in a country have changed since the base year.

The cost of buying a CPI market basket of goods and services in the current year divided by the cost of the same CPI market basket in the base year. 



Constructing the CPI involves three stages:

Selecting the CPI market basket

Conducting a monthly price survey

Calculating the CPI





Constructing the CPI involves three stages:



Selecting the CPI market basket

Conducting a monthly price survey

The Monthly Price Survey: every month, BLS employees check the prices of the 80,000 goods in the market basket in 30 metropolitan areas. 

Calculating the CPI

Assume that households buy the same market basket of products each period when calculate CPI

Find the cost of the market basket at base-period prices.

Find the cost of the market basket at current-period prices.

Calculate the CPI for the current period.

Practice Questions

Assume that the market basket of 2 units of peanut butter, and 10 units of jelly. Take 2010 as the base year, and calculate the CPI of 2020 based on year 2010.

2010 PPeanut butter=$2

2020 PPeanut butter=$5

2010 PJelly=$1

2020 PJelly=$2



Answer:

Expenditure of basket in base year = $2x2+$1x10=$14

Expenditure of basket in current year = $5x2+$2x10=$30

CPI2020 = ($30/$14)x100=214.29



CPI2010=100

The limitations of CPI

Limitations in application

the CPI may not be applicable to all population groups. For example:

The CPI-U is designed to measure inflation for the U.S. urban population and thus may not accurately reflect the experience of people living in rural areas. 

The CPI does not produce official estimates for the rate of inflation experienced by subgroups of the population, such as the elderly or the poor



Limitations in measurement

Sampling error. 

Because the CPI measures price changes based on a sample of items, the published indexes differ somewhat from what the results would be if actual records of all retail purchases by everyone in the index population could be used to compile the index. These estimating or sampling errors are limitations on the accuracy of the index, not mistakes in calculating the index. The CPI program has developed measurements of sampling error, called variance estimates, which are updated and published annually at CPI Variance Estimates. The CPI sample design allocates the sample in a way that maximizes the accuracy of the index, given the funds available.

Non-sampling error. 

These errors occur from a variety of sources and unlike sampling errors, they can cause persistent bias in measurements of the index. Non-sampling errors are caused by problems of price data collection, logistical lags in conducting surveys, difficulties in defining basic concepts and their operational implementation, and difficulties in handling the problems of quality change. Non-sampling errors can be far more hazardous to the accuracy of a price index than sampling errors so we expend considerable effort to minimize these errors. Highly trained personnel ensure the comparability of quality of items from period to period; collection procedures are extensively documented, and recurring audits are conducted. The CPI program has an ongoing research and evaluation program in order to identify and implement improvements in the index.

The limitations of CPI

Because of the significant limitations of this experimental index, it should be interpreted with caution.



The CPI might overstate the actual inflation rate for several reasons:

New goods bias

Quality change bias

Commodity substitution bias

Outlet substitution bias

Inflation

Measuring the Inflation Rate

The major purpose of the CPI is to measure inflation.

The inflation rate is the percentage change in the price level in a period of time.

The annual inflation rate from year t to year t+1:

Practice Questions

Suppose a market basket contains 10 units of massage and 50 units of pizza. 

Calculate CPI2020 and CPI2021 base on year 2010.

Calculate the (annual) inflation rate from 2020 to 2021.

Suppose Mike earned $10,000 in year 2020. Given the inflation, he wanted to ask for a pay rise. How much dollar amount should he ask for his 2021 salary in order to keep his purchasing power constant?

If the inflation rate was lower from 2021 to 2022 (than the one from 2020 to 2021), does it imply a deflation?



Practice Questions



Deflation?

Inflation, 

b/c inflation rate >0%

The relationship between the price level and the inflation rate

The inflation rate is

High and positive when the price level is rising rapidly 

Low and positive when the price level is rising slowly

Negative when the price level is falling



GDP deflator and CPI

The GDP deflator and the CPI formula look nearly identical.  

Question: What are the differences?  

Hint: Think about what is in each “basket” of goods and services.

The GDP deflator includes things not purchased by households, like trains, subways, and submarines.

The CPI includes imports like Chinese laptops.

Housing-related expenditures like shelter and utility bills have a large weight in the CPI.

More Price Indices

Producer Price Index, PPI

measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products and some services.

Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, PCE

A measure of the prices that people living in the United States, or those buying on their behalf, pay for goods and services. The PCE price index is known for capturing inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflecting changes in consumer behavior.
