why
As crive slopes up
· W unchanged along the same SRAS crive
&
· if a shock causes W1 Shift SRAS to the left

#1 permanent change in A, K, and/or L
• Shift LRAS
• Shift SRAS
#2 temporary change in A, K, and/or L
• LRAS stays unchanged
• Shift SRAS
#3 change in money input prices
• LRAS stays unchanged
• Shift SRAS
#4 change in price level only (which might be caused by the change in AD)
• Move along LRAS
• Move along SRAS

Textbook conclusions:
Suppose (1) the economy starts from a full-employment equilibrium, and (2) no further
shocks or government intervention thereafter
• If LRAS constant but a shock causes AD
⬇
then over time SRAS

gradually to
bring the short-run equilibrium back to its potential (long-run equilibrium)
• If LRAS constant but a shock causes AD

then over time SRAS
