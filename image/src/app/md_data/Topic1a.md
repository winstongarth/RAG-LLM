Introduction to Economics 

Chapter 1-2

What is Economics?

Is there a limitation on how much money you can spend each month?

What is Economics?

Your limited budget is one example of limited resources (scarce resources).



Scarcity: A situation in which unlimited wants exceed the limited resources available to fulfill those wants

What is Economics?

When you decide how to spend your budget, you are a decision maker (economic agent).



Economic agents: decision makers.

In economics, agents are

self interest

rational

using all available information to achieve your goals.

Rational consumers and firms weigh the benefits and costs of each action and try to make the best decision possible.



What is Economics?

Textbook: Economics is the study of

how agents choose to allocate scarce resources, and

how those choices affects society.



Your understanding?



What is Macroeconomics?

Economics concludes:

Microeconomics is the study of

how households and firms make choices,

how they interact in markets, and 

how the government attempts to influence their choices

 how individuals firms, and governments make choices.

Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole.

The economic way of thinking

Optimization: choosing the best feasible option with given constraints (information, knowledge, budget, experience, training, etc).

Equilibrium: a situation in which everyone is simultaneously optimizing, so nobody would benefit personally by changing his or her own behavior, given the choices of others.

Next: one example of equilibrium







Assume all you care about is to arrive your destination sooner and you don't need to exit any time soon.

Will you change lane if you are one of the red cars?

Will you change lane if you are one of the blue cars?

Is it an equilibrium?

Will you change lane if you are one of the red cars?

This intro level class concentrates on the “good equilibria” only.

Resource use is efficient if it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off.





The economic way of thinking

Empiricism is analysis that uses data, evidence-based analysis.

Economists use data to develop theories, to test theories, to evaluate the success of different government policies, and to determine what is causing things to happen in the world.

The circular-flow model

The circular-flow model

Market: a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service and the institution or arrangement by which they come together to trade

A free market is one with few government restrictions on how a good or service can be produced or sold, or on how a factor of production can be employed.



Goods (and services) markets are markets in which goods and services are bought and sold.

Factor markets are markets in which factors of production are bought and sold.

The circular-flow model

Labor: the effort that people contribute to the production of goods and services. 

Examples: work done by the waiter who brings your food; artist's creation of a painting.

The circular-flow model

Land: includes any natural resource used to produce goods and services; anything that comes from the land. 

Some common land or natural resources are water, oil, copper, natural gas, coal, and forests. 

Land resources are the raw materials in the production process. 

These resources can be renewable, such as forests, or nonrenewable such as oil or natural gas.

The circular-flow model

Capital: manufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services.

The tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other constructions that businesses used for production.

Examples: hammers, forklifts, computers, delivery vans, textbooks, whiteboards, etc.



The circular-flow model

(Physical) capital: 

includes business structures (plants) and equipment (machines) used for production.



Financial capital:

 the funds that firms use to buy physical capital.



The circular-flow model

Entrepreneurship: is someone who brings together the factors of production—land, labor, and capital—to produce goods and services and earn profits.

The most successful entrepreneurs are innovators who find new ways to produce goods and services or who develop new goods and services to bring to market. 

Entrepreneurs can be a vital engine of economic growth (helping to build some of the largest firms in the world)



The circular-flow model

Rent: income paid for the use of land

Wages: Income paid for the services of labor

Interest: Income paid for the use of capital

Profit (or loss): Income earned by an entrepreneur for running a business







The circular-flow model

Real flow:

In goods markets

Who offers goods and services?

Who receives goods and services?

In factor markets (say labor market)

Who offers production factors?

Who receives production factors?



Real Flow: orange flows.

The circular-flow model

Money flow:

In goods markets

Who pays money?

Who receives money?

In factor markets (say labor market)

Who pays money?

Who receives money?

The circular-flow model

Real Flow

Orange flows



Money Flow

Blue flows: incomes

Red flows: expenditures



The circular-flow model

Questions:

Are there any elements you want to add to this 4-sector circular flow model?

Households do not always spend all their income. Are savings a leakage from circular flow?





Economic model

Economic model: simplified versions of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations 

It is a description of some aspect of the economic world that includes only those features that are needed for the purpose at hand.



Economic models

Economists develop economic models to analyze real-world issues.

Building an economic model often follows these steps:

Decide on the assumptions to use in developing the model.

Formulate a testable hypothesis.

Use economic data to test the hypothesis.

Revise the model if it fails to explain the economic data well.

Retain the revised model to help answer similar economic questions in the future.

Assumptions and simplifications: every model needs them in order to be useful.

Testability: good models generate testable predictions, which can be verified or disproven using data.

Economic variables: something measurable that can have different values, such as the incomes of doctors.



The scientific nature of economics

Economists try to mimic natural scientists by using the scientific method. But economics is a social science; studying the behavior of people is often tricky.



When analyzing human behavior, we can perform:

Positive analysis: the study of “what is?”; and/or

Normative analysis: the study of “what ought to be?”



Economists generally perform positive analysis.



Types of economies

Centrally planned economies result when governments decide what to produce, how to produce it, and who received the goods and services.



Market economies result when the decisions of households and firms determine what is produced, how it is produced, and who receives the goods and services.



Mixed economies have features of both of the above. Most economic decisions result from the interaction of buyers and sellers, but governments play a significant role in the allocation of resources.



Efficiency of economies

Market economies tend to be more efficient than centrally-planned economies.



Market economies promote:

Productive efficiency, where goods or services are produced at the lowest possible cost; and

Allocative efficiency, where production is consistent with consumer preferences: the marginal benefit of production is equal to its marginal cost



These efficiencies come about because all transactions result from voluntary exchange: transactions that make both the buyer and seller better off.



Efficiency of economies

Markets may not result in fully efficient outcomes. For example:

People might not immediately do things in the most efficient way

Governments might interfere with market outcomes

Market outcomes might ignore the desires of people who are not involved in transactions – ex: pollution



Economically efficient outcomes may not be the most desirable. Markets result in high inequality; some people prefer more equity, i.e. fairer distribution of economic benefits.
