Seoul

Apartment price per square meter: 29,657,591.44‚Ç© 

Hong Kong Island

Apartment price per square meter: 184,000HKD

->  ‚ÄúApartments on average are more expensive in Seoul.‚Äù

Is that a true statement?



Unit matters!



‚Äú The minimum wage in 2007 is higher than the minimum wage in 1968‚Äù

Is that a true statement?







Ignore pollical views in this video. Focus on the economic aspects.

A History Of The Minimum Wage | TIME

0:00-1:00; 3:00-3:56





The purchasing power of money matters! 

Real wage rate makes better sense

Convert all to the same units before comparison

In 1909, then U.S. President William Howard Taft was paid $75,000.

In 2016, former U.S. President Barack Obama was paid $400,000.

Price index in 1909 = 9

Price index in 2016 = 239.5

Real vs. Nominal

The interest rate on a financial asset is the interest received expressed as a percentage of the price of the asset.

For example, if the price of the asset is $50 and the interest is $5, then the interest rate is 10 percent.

If the asset price rises (say to $200), other things remaining the same, the interest rate falls (2.5 percent). 

If the asset price falls (say to $20), other things remaining the same, the interest rate rises (to 25 percent).





The Fisher equation

ùëñ: nominal interest rate

ùëÖ: real interest rate

ùúã: inflation rate

Practice Question

On 1/1/2022, you decide to lend your friend Amy $1,000 for one year and you expect a 1% inflation in the following year. 

If you want a 3% real return, what is the nominal interest rate you should ask for?

How much money will Amy need to pay as interest on 1/1/2023?

If the inflation rate in 2022 turns out to be 5%, will you be happy with the interest you receive?

If the inflation rate in 2022 turns out to be 5%, will Amy be happy with the interest she pays?

Practice Question

On 1/1/2022, you decide to lend your friend Amy $1,000 for one year and you expects an 1% inflation in the following year. 

If you want a 3% real return, what is the nominal interest rate you should ask for?

3%+1%=4%

How much money will Amy need to pay as interest on 1/1/2023?

4%*$1,000=$40

If the inflation rate in 2022 turns out to be 5%, will you be happy with the interest you receive?

No. Your real return from lending is 4%-5%=-1%  and lower than what you have expected

If the inflation rate in 2022 turns out to be 5%, will Amy be happy with the interest she pays?

Yes. Her real interest rate from borrowing is 4%-5%=-1%  and lower than what she has expected











Who wins and who loses from unexpected inflation?

A homeowner paying a mortgage at a fixed rate of interest

win

A bank receiving payments on a mortgage at a fixed rate of interest

lose

Retiree who receives a pension that is not indexed for inflation

lose

The owners of a firm paying a pension that is not indexed for inflation

win

A worker who has sticky wage

sticky wage: the wage doesn‚Äôt adjust to inflation in the short term, even if the wage will adjust to inflation in the long term (maybe every two years) 

lose

Practice Question

Unexpected inflation causes problems such as random redistribution of wealth. 



Under inflation, all prices and all wages do not  always move together.  

Under inflation, some relative prices, including the real wage and real interest rate, can change.

This creates winners who benefit from unexpected gains and losers who suffer from unexpected losses.
