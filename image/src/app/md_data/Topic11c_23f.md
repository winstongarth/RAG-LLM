What is Quantitative Easing?



Chair Powell

“Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy. ”

“The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt. ”



“As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼ percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. ”



“The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings. ”

Quantitative Tightening (QT)

Monetary Policy

Quantitative tightening (QT) refers to monetary policies that contract, or reduce, the size of the Federal Reserve System balance sheet. 

This process is also known as balance sheet normalization when after using QE in a period of crisis, the central bank returns to normal balance sheet operations. 

The Fed shrinks its monetary reserves by either selling Treasury securities or letting them mature and removing them from its cash balances.

Quantitative Tightening Explained (and What it Means for Markets)

Federal Reserve Board: What is the difference between monetary policy and fiscal policy, and how are they related?

https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12855.htm



Monetary policy refers to the actions of central banks to achieve macroeconomic policy objectives such as price stability, full employment, and stable economic growth. 

Fiscal policy refers to the tax and spending policies of the federal government. 

Fiscal policy decisions are determined by the Congress and the Administration; the Fed plays no role in determining fiscal policy.

The U.S. Congress established maximum employment and price stability as the macroeconomic objectives for the Federal Reserve; they are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. 

Apart from these overarching objectives, the Congress determined that operational conduct of monetary policy should be free from political influence. 

As a result, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency of the federal government.



The monetary policymaking body within the Federal Reserve System is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC currently has eight scheduled meetings per year, during which it reviews economic and financial developments and determines the appropriate stance of monetary policy. 

In reviewing the economic outlook, the FOMC considers how the current and projected paths for fiscal policy might affect key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product growth, employment, and inflation. 

In this way, fiscal policy has an indirect effect on the conduct of monetary policy through its influence on the aggregate economy and the economic outlook. 

For example, if federal tax and spending programs are projected to boost economic growth, the Federal Reserve would assess how those programs would affect its key macroeconomic objectives--maximum employment and price stability--and make appropriate adjustments to its monetary policy tools.



Consequences of Policies

Consequences of Policies

Lowering the inflation rate in the short run

At the cost of a slumping economy in the short run

Higher unemployment and lost output in the short run 

Contractionary monetary policy slows down growth in bank reserves, raises interest rates, reduces borrowing, slows growth in the money supply, and reduces the rate of inflation.

Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet

Roll off

When QE ended, the Fed reinvested any maturing securities to maintain the size of its balance sheet.

With QT, the Fed stopped reinvesting up to $30 billion in maturing Treasuries and $17.5 billion in maturing MBS every month, passively shrinking its assets as those securities "roll off" without being replaced.

Last Resort Loans

Last resort loans

Last resort: the last party that you can turn to for help.

A bank that finds itself short of reserves and unable to borrow sufficient amounts in financial markets may turn to the discount window of the Fed. This is one way in which the Fed functions as the lender of the last resort.

The Discount Rate

A bank that finds itself short of reserves and unable to borrow sufficient amounts in financial markets may turn to the discount window of the Fed. This is one way in which the Fed functions as the lender of the last resort. 

The discount rate is the interest rate charged by the Fed on loans that it makes to commercial banks and other financial institutions.
