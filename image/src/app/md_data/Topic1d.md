Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium

Chapter 3-4

Perfectly competitive market 

Many firms. 

Each firm sells an identical product, therefore has no market power and takes market prices as given.

Many buyers. 

Each buyer takes market prices as given.



Every buyer pays and every seller charges the same market price, no buyer or seller is big enough to influence the market price.



Who are demanders?

If you are an average demander, keeping everything else constant, do you prefer a higher or lower price?

Considering all the demanders in the market, if the price is higher while everything else stays constant, will they buy more? Or less? Why?

Demand

If you demand something, then you

want it.

can afford it. 

plan to buy it.



Demand reflects the choices of demanders 

(households, consumers, etc)



The law of demand states: 

other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity demanded; and

the lower the price of a good, the larger is the quantity demanded.

Demand

Quantity Demanded: is the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a given price.



Demand, or Demand Schedule: a table or schedule that reports the quantity demanded at different prices, holding all else equal.



Demand Curve: plots the demand schedule

Original  QD

Change in quantity demanded:

When the price of the good changes and other things remain the same, the quantity demanded changes and there is a movement along the demand curve.

Who are suppliers?

If you run a firm, keeping everything else constant, do you prefer a higher or a lower price for your product?

Considering all the firms in the market, if the price is higher while everything else stays constant, will they produce more? Or less? Why?

Supply

Quantity Supplied: the amount of a good that sellers are willing to sell at a given price.

Supply, or Supply Schedule: a schedule that reports the quantity supplied at different prices.

Supply Curve: plots the supply schedule.



The law of supply states: 

other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the greater is the quantity supplied; and

the lower the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity supplied. 







Change in quantity supplied

When the price of the good changes and other influences on sellers’ plans remain the same, the quantity supplied changes and there is a movement along the supply curve. 

Change in Supply

Shifts of the Supply Curve occur when one of the following changes:

input prices 

technology

number and scale of sellers

sellers’ expectations about the future

availability and prices of related goods

Substitutes in production

Complements in production

Supply

Generally speaking, perfume producers have the necessary skills, facilities and resources to produce hand sanitizer. 

perfume and hand sanitizer are substitutes in production.

Equilibrium

Equilibrium: a situation in which everyone is simultaneously optimizing, so nobody would benefit personally by changing his or her own behavior, given the choices of others.





Is it an equilibrium?



Excess Supply occurs when suppliers provide more than consumers want at a given price. 

This situation results in a surplus.







What do you expect to happen when surplus presents?



What do you expect to happen when surplus presents?

Surplus drives price down







Is it an equilibrium?



Excess Demand occurs when consumers want more than suppliers provide at a given price. 

This situation results in a shortage.







What do you expect to happen when shortage presents?



What do you expect to happen when shortage presents?

Shortage drives price up





Equilibrium

Competitive Equilibrium: the situation at which the market comes to an agreement about what the price will be (competitive equilibrium price) and how much will be exchanged (competitive equilibrium quantity) at that price. 

The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

The equilibrium quantity is the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.









Equilibrium







Equilibrium

The market price is determined by the Market Demand (households/consumers) and Market Supply (firms/producers) jointly.



Price regulates buying and selling plans.

Price adjusts when plans don’t match: 

a shortage forces the price up

a surplus forces the price down.

Only at the market equilibrium will the QD=QS. 







What would happen to the Peqm and Qeqm of electric cars today if (keeping everything else constant):

People are becoming more concerned about the environment

A lower income tax makes consumers richer

An innovative technology decreases the production cost of car batteries

The steel (inputs for cars) price doubles

All public transportations are about to be free for all citizens

Stores like Walmart build more charging stations

Consumers anticipate that electric cars will become cheaper in the coming year, whereas producers will now receive subsidies.

The Invisible Hand

Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” idea in the Wealth of Nations implied that competitive markets send resources to their highest valued use in society.

Consumers and producers pursue their own self-interest and interact in markets.

Market transactions generate an efficient—highest valued—use of resources.

Price Regulation

A price ceiling or price cap is a regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than a specified level.





Problem Set

If a price ceiling is imposed above the equilibrium in a competitive market, then:

Equilibrium? Shortage? Surplus?

Is the market still efficient?



If a price ceiling is imposed below the equilibrium in a competitive market, then:

Equilibrium? Shortage? Surplus?

Is the market still efficient?



A black market is an illegal market that operates alongside a legal market. Ignore the risk of getting caught. If there is an effective price ceiling in the legal market, then

A price ceiling or price cap is a regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than a specified level.

If the price ceiling is set above the equilibrium price, it has no effect. The market works as if there were no ceiling. 

But if the rent ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, it has powerful effects.



A price floor is a regulation that makes it illegal to trade at a price lower than a specified level.

If the price floor is set below the equilibrium price, it has no effect.

The market works as if there were no price regulation. If the price floor is set above the equilibrium price, it has powerful effects.

Price Regulation

Appendix

* Why does a change in the price change the quantity demanded 

* Potential obstacles to efficiency

* Some real-world examples









* Helpful but not required for the exam



Why does a change in the price change the quantity demanded?

Two reasons:

 Substitution effect: When the price of a good or service rises relative to other goods or services, people seek substitutes for it, so the quantity demanded of the good or service decreases.

Income effect: When the price of a normal good or service rises relative to income, people cannot afford all the things they previously bought, so the quantity demanded of the good or service decreases.

In competitive markets, inefficiency arise when there are

Price and quantity regulations

Taxes and subsidies

Externalities

Public goods and common resources

Monopoly

High transactions costs
