AS-AD Model

Aggregate demand and aggregate supply model: A model that explains short-run fluctuations in real GDP and the price level.



Aggregate Demand

Why is the AD Curve Downward Sloping?

Not required for the exam

Aggregate demand curve

The relationship between price level and quantity demanded by all sectors of economy, holding everything else constant



A change in the price level not caused by a component of AD changing results in a movement along the same AD curve.

On the other hand, any change in a component of AD other than the price level will result in a shift of the AD curve.



Buying plans depend on many factors and some of the main ones are

Expectations

Fiscal policy and monetary policy

The world economy

And more shocks



Practice Questions

What would happen to the U.S. AD curve if:

Chinese households start purchasing less U.S. produced goods

NX↓ AD↓, shift AD to the left

An income tax cut increases disposable income (assume government spending stays unchanged)

C↑, I ↑  AD↑, shift AD to the right

The gloomy economic outlook harms the investment

I↓ AD↓, shift AD to the left

Philadelphia is chosen to host the 2024 Olympics, and must build infrastructure for it

G↑ AD↑, shift AD to the right

The Fed starts implementing policies that cut real interest rates.

C↑, I ↑  AD↑, shift AD to the right

Prices level rises as most of the goods and services becoming more expensive.

Move along the same AD curve

Workers become more productive 

AD curve stays constant while AS curve would shift



Aggregate Supply

The quantity of aggregate supplied (quantity of real GDP supplied) is the total quantity of goods and services that firms plan to produce during a given period at a specific price level.

Aggregate supply curve: a curve that shows the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied by firms and the price level:

 Long-run aggregate supply (LRAS or LAS)

 Short-run aggregate supply (SRAS or SAS)



LRAS







It does not

For simplicity, assume the nominal wage doesn’t change with the price level

Quantity of LRAS unchanged

In the short run, the quantity of real GDP supplied increases if the price level rises.

The SRAS curve slopes upward.

A rise in the price level with no change in the nominal wage rate induces firms to increase production.

Potential real GDP

Why is the SRAS Curve Upward Sloping?

Economists tend to believe that some firms and workers fail to accurately predict changes in the price level.

Based on this, there are two more potential explanations for why the SRAS curve is upward-sloping:

Contracts make some prices “sticky”

Menu costs make some prices sticky

Refer to textbook chapter 13 for further explanations.

Not required for the exam

How Sticky Are Wages?

There is disagreement among economists about how sticky wages and prices actually are.

To examine this, it is best to look at individual worker-level data.

Some recent studies have done this, finding firms are reluctant to cut workers (nominal) wages. Instead, they:

Offer lower salaries to new hires

Fire current workers

Decreases raises or freeze pay



Not required for the exam

SRAS

We will always assume constant expected inflation when analyzing the impact of shocks on the economy in this intro-level class.

The effect of an increase in potential real GDP:

The LRAS curve shifts rightward and the SRAS curve shifts along with the LRAS curve.

The effect of a rise in the nominal wage:

Short-run aggregate supply decreases and the SRAS curve shifts leftward.

Long-run aggregate supply does not change. 

Long-Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium

occurs when the quantity of real GDP demanded equals real potential GDP

when the economy is on its LRAS curve.

Long-run equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the AD and LRAS curves.



Short-Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium

occurs when the quantity of real GDP demanded equals the quantity of real GDP supplied at the point of intersection of the AD curve and the SRAS curve.

If real GDP is below equilibrium GDP, prices raise and firms increase production…

… and if real GDP is above equilibrium GDP, prices decrease and firms decrease production. 

These changes bring a movement along the SAS curve towards equilibrium.

In short-run equilibrium, real GDP can be greater than or less than the potential real GDP.

Practice Questions

Assume constant expected inflation. Starting from a full-employment equilibrium, how would the short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibria be affected by the following shocks:

A temporary natural disaster

A permanent technological advancement

The Fed starts implementing policies that cut real interest rates 

These policies are not permanent and will not remain in effect indefinitely

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has intensified the pressure on oil prices

It is not permanent and will not remain in effect indefinitely



A positive demand shock

Explaining Macroeconomic Trends and Fluctuations



A negative supply shock

Explaining Macroeconomic Trends and Fluctuations



In short-run equilibrium, real GDP can be greater than or less than the potential real GDP.

Practice Questions

Assume constant expected inflation. Starting from a full-employment equilibrium: 

If there were a sudden increase in oil prices, and no further shocks or government interventions occurred thereafter, what would be the impact on the short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibria over time?

If firms became more optimistic about the future, and no further shocks or government interventions occurred thereafter, what would be the impact on the short-run and long-run macroeconomic equilibria over time?



Suppose a sudden increase in oil prices shifts SRAS curve to the left 



This causes stagflation, a combination of inflation and recession, usually resulting from a supply shock. 





How long does it take to restore full employment?

It depends on the severity of the supply shock, but it is likely to take several years.

An alternative to waiting this long is to use fiscal or monetary policy to increase aggregate demand.

There is generally a trade-off between output and inflation in the short run.

This might result in higher prices but may be worth the cost.

 The Financial Crisis of 2007-2009









 Helpful but not required for the exam





Does It Matter What Causes AD to Fall?

GDP has four components; an decrease in any of the four could cause a recession. Does it make any difference which component causes the recession?

Most post-WWII recessions in the U.S. have been preceded by falls in residential construction

Recent research suggests that recessions caused by financial crises tend to be larger and more long-lasting than declines due to other factors





Forecasts for Returning to Potential Real GDP

After the 2007-2009 recession, different groups estimated how long itwould take to return to potential GDP.

In 2011, the White House and the Congressional Budget Office estimated that we would return to full employment by 2016.

The Federal Reserve disagreed, believing it would take even longer.

For comparison, the second worst post-Depression recession was in 1981-1982; recovery then took less than three years.





Forecasts for Returning to Potential Real GDP

How accurate were these forecasts? It turns out, they were too optimistic.

Economists still disagree about why the U.S. economy was taking so long to return to potential real GDP.



Dynamic AS-AD Model

Illustrates inflation

If the quantity of money grows faster than the potential real GDP, aggregate demand increases by more than long-run aggregate supply.

The AD curve shifts rightward faster than the rightward shift of the LRAS curve.

Illustrates inflation (continued)

SRAS moves to the right; but the anticipated rise in the price level causes it to move less far than LRAS

Long run equilibrium is restored but with a higher price level.

Using dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply to understand inflation

The Financial Crisis of 2007-2009

Three main factors combined to cause the recession:

The end of the housing bubble

House prices rose in the early 2000s—initially due to low interest rates, but then due to speculation. In 2006, the speculative bubble began to deflate, and the spending on residential investment fell.

The financial crisis

As many people defaulted on their mortgages, many financial institutions took heavy losses. This financial crisis led to a credit crunch, decreasing consumption and investment spending.

The rapid increase in oil prices during 2008

Several factors combined to increase the price of oil from $34 per barrel in 2004 to $140 per barrel in mid-2008. This supply shock exacerbated the ongoing recession.



The Financial Crisis of 2007-2009

In 2007, the economy was more or less in long-run equilibrium.

As usual, potential real GDP increased from 2007 to 2008.

But aggregate demand did not keep pace (housing bubble, financial crisis).

At the same time, increasing oil prices shifted short-run aggregate supply cruve to the left.

The result: higher prices and below-potential real GDP.
