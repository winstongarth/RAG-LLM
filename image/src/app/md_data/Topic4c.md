Unemployment and Labor market

Chapter 9 



Simplifying Assumptions

Assume price level, or the purchasing power of money, is constant.

money wage = real wage

The aggregate labor market is perfectly competitive. 

All workers have the same skill level

No market participant has significant market power

Participants take wage as given

Assume the working hours per day per worker is constant and is the same for all workers.

Labor Market

The demand for labor is determined by firms that want to maximize profits. 

The supply of labor is determined by workers who want to maximize utility. 



The perfectly competitive labor market is where the equilibrium real wage and aggregate quantity of labor are determined.

Real wage rate: inflation adjusted wage rate





Problem Set

The table below describes how production changes with each additional worker hired by the car wash. 

Suppose the price of a car wash is $7 and the wage per hour is $15. 

Should the manager hire the 8th worker?

What is the optimal amount of worker hired?

Problem Set

The table below describes how production changes with each additional worker hired by the car wash. 

(3) If the price of a car wash increased to $14 per hour while holding all other factors constant, would a higher output price impact the optimal number of workers to hire?

Problem Set

The table below describes how production changes with each additional worker hired by the car wash. 

(4) If both the price of a car wash and the money wage increase by the same degree due to an inflation, for example, to $14 and $30 respectively. Keeping everything else constant, would this affect the optimal number of workers to hire?

Problem Set

The table below describes how production changes with each additional worker hired by the car wash. 

(5) Assuming a 100% inflation rate, if the price of a car wash increases to $14 while the money wage in the short run cannot immediately keep up with the inflation, would this impact the optimal number of workers to hire?

Practice Question

What would happen in a perfectly competitive aggregate labor market, if:

Working-age population grows due to relaxed immigration policies

Higher output prices due to a higher demand from foreign countries

A better education system makes workers work more efficiently (higher labor productivity)

The government implements regulations to make laying off workers more difficult

Inflation results in a simultaneous increase in both output prices and money wages by the same magnitude

A better technology

Working-age Population growth



The labor supply curve shifts rightward.

real wage rate falls

aggregate hours  increase.





Higher output prices 



The labor demand curve shifts rightward.

real wage rate increases

aggregate hours  increase





Higher labor productivity



The labor demand curve shifts rightward.

real wage rate increases

aggregate hours  increase





The government implements regulations to make laying off workers more difficult:

Firms will demand fewer workers

Labor demand shifts left

Real wages and employment fall

Initially the unemployment rate rises but recovers as discouraged workers drop out of the labor force





Complements in production?



Substitutes in production?

How could Amazon Go change the labor market for low-skilled workers (such as cashiers)?

How could Amazon Go change the labor market for high-skilled workers (such as machine learning engineers and data scientists)?

Kiosk and wait-staff:

substitutes in production

Kiosk and engineers: 

complements in production

What makes the shifts of the labor supply curve:

Practice Question

What would happen in a perfectly competitive aggregate labor market if :

Lower output prices due to a lower demand from foreign countries

In the above situation, workers and labor unions refuse to accept the new equilibrium wage rate



Wage Rigidity

Wage rigidity

Wages fail to adjust after a shock to labor demand or supply

Households refuse to accept a lower wage



What happens if wages do not fall in the demand shock example?

The labor market will not clear and this results in a larger fall in employment

Increase unemployment 

If ignore discouraged worker effect  increased unemployment 



Minimum Wage

In 2017, the Graduate-Students’ Association in my graduate school negotiated with the university and successfully raised the benefit (pay, insurance, tuition remission, etc.) for graduate students who work as TAs, RAs and instructors.

Guess what happened then?

Minimum Wage

What is the purpose of minimum wage? Is the purpose good?

You run a very small business with very limited profit margin. After the government raising the minimum wage, what would you do if you cannot afford to pay all your employees the new rate?

Given the potential reaction from business owners, do you think minimum wage serves its purpose well?

What can we do if we want to help low-income families?





Minimum Wage

Minimum Wage

Labor market in real life is not perfectly competitive!

Workers have locational preferences

Worker mobility is limited

Asymmetric information

In a local monopolistic labor market where employers hold monopoly power, does the minimum wage policy provide any benefits?

Minimum Wage and Poverty

Cited from Econ2232, Prof. SUEN Wing Chuen



Most supporters of the minimum wage propose it as an anti-poverty measure. Is it effective?

coverage is small

minimum wage workers are not always from poor households—teenage workers

and second earners

effects on prices

jobless people do not benefit

Many minimum wage workers (e.g., teenagers) are second earners in the family. A rise in minimum wage for such workers may have little effect on reducing poverty. Minimum wage increased from $3.35 to $4.25 between 1989 and 1992 in the U.S. Only 7.1% of workers were directly affected. About 19% of the increased income generated by higher minimum wage accrued to poor households.

Costs of minimum wage increases may be passed back to consumers. Thomas MaCurdy (2015) finds that these extra costs attributable to higher prices equaled 0.63% of non-durable goods purchases made by the poorest fifth of households, and 0.52% of non-durable goods purchases made by the top fifth.

Higher prices are born disproportionately by poorer households because the poor tend to spend a disproportionate share of the income on goods produced by minimum-wage worker intensive industries (e.g., fast food restaurants, retail services, groceries, etc.)
