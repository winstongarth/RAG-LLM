Short-run vs. Long-run

Chapter 17

Supplementary Materials from Charles Jones

Real GDP fluctuates around potential GDP.

Potential GDP grows at a steady pace because the quantities of the factors of production and their productivity grow at a steady pace

Short Run vs. Long Run



Output gap

Short Run vs. Long Run

Short-run output fluctuations:

Detrended output

The difference in actual and potential real output, expressed as a percentage of potential real output



Output gap

Detrended output

U.S. Economic Fluctuations, 1970-2015



Growth rate of potential output

Velocity of money

The average number of times per year that each piece of paper currency is used in a transaction

How fast each paper currency change hands

V always assumed to be constant in the long run, so V=k which k is a positive constant.

The Quantity theory of money(long run)

Short Run vs. Long Run





U.S. Economic Fluctuations, 1970-2015



Short-Run Output in the United States

Fluctuations in U.S. GDP:

Difficult to see graphically over a long period of time

Have mostly been between + or – 4% since 1950

The Great Depression:

Negative gap during the 1930s

Actual output was well below potential

In the short run

During the expansion

Demand ↑

Price ↑

Price level ↑



Short Run vs. Long Run

The Phillips curve shows, in the short run:

A boom increases inflation

A recession decreases inflation

A positive relationship between the change in inflation and short-run output

Empirically, the slope is about 1⁄3

If real output exceeds potential by 3%, the inflation rate increases one percentage point





Short Run vs. Long Run

Okun’s Law

Short-run Phillips Curve

Short Run vs. Long Run

The short-run model is based on 3 premises:

The economy is constantly being hit by shocks

Shocks: factors that cause fluctuations

Monetary and fiscal policies affect output

Policymakers can neutralize shocks to the economy

There is generally a trade-off between output and inflation in the short run
