Catch-up Effect

Catch-up effect: is a theory that underdeveloped economies tend to grow more rapidly than wealthier economies. 

The effect of additional capital is greater for countries with smaller initial capital stocks

Diminishing MPK

There are greater advances in technology immediately available to poorer countries



Examining high-income countries, we see strong evidence of the catch-up hypothesis.

Countries that were richer in 1960, like the U.S. and Switzerland, experienced lower growth rates over the next decades than countries that were initially poorer, like Ireland, Singapore, and South Korea.

However if we extend the set of countries to all countries for which statistics are available, our catch-up model appears to be worthless.

We need to address the failures of the catch-up model.



Catch-up Effect

Economists point to four key factors in explaining why many low-income countries are growing so slowly:

Failure to enforce the rule of law

For entrepreneurs in a market economy to succeed, the government must guarantee property rights: the rights individuals or firms have to the exclusive use of their property, including the right to buy or sell it. Otherwise, entrepreneurs will not risk starting a business.

Wars and revolutions

Poor public education and health

Low rates of saving and investment

Undeveloped and insecure financial systems

Effect of Business Cycles on Firms

Historically, recessions have generally been followed by periods of strong economic growth.

Some firms take advantage of the low real interest rates that typically accompany a recession to make investments by expanding productive capacity, effectively betting that the growth will justify their investments.

For example, VF Corporation (the largest apparel maker in the world, including brands such as North Face, Timberland, and Wrangler) decided to open 89 new stores in 2008 and 70 in 2009.

By 2013, the company’s sales and profits continued to increase, making their decision look very smart.

When a recession hits, workers reduce spending due to expectations about their current and future incomes decreasing.

But this reduction in spending doesn’t affect all goods equally. Consumers mostly continue to buy nondurables like food and clothing. But purchases of durable goods, ones that (by definition) are expected to last three or more years, are more strongly affected.

This includes goods like furniture, appliances, and automobiles—goods that consumers can continue to use for a little longer when their purchasing power decreases.

Hence firms selling durable goods are more likely to be hit hard by a recession.

The charts show that the entire household appliance industry was particularly hard-hit by the recession of 2007-2009.

Economic Growth in the United States

Growth rates in the United States were relatively modestprior to 1900.

In the 20th century, firms and the U.S. government invested heavily in research and development, resulting in increasing growth rates.

Growth rates remained high until the mid-1970s, when they fell unexpectedly, before picking up again in the mid-1990s.



Economic Growth in the United States

Some economists argue that there was not really a slowdown in economic growth—the appearance is a result of how we measure growth.

From the 1970s, most growth in output came in the form of services rather than goods. Improvements in services come mostly through quality differences, which are harder to measure for services than for goods.

An alternative argument is that America concentrated more on quality-of-life issues, like health and safety, environmental regulations, and a change in educational focus.

Other high-income countries experienced similarly timed slowdowns, suggesting that the United States was not doing something uniquely counterproductive over this time.

New technology has driven improvements in labor productivity from 1996-2012.

Examples: faster data processing (computers etc.); better communication (cell phones, the internet)

Some economists argue that changes in quality of services have been particularly important over the last decade and a half.

So GDP growth has understated the actual growth of the economy.

But it may be that many of these gains are going toward improving consumer products rather than improving labor productivity.

This casts doubt on the future of economic growth in the U.S.
