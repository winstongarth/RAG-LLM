PPF

Chapter 2, 7



The Production Possibilities Frontier

Assume you have a maximum of 16 hours each day to study. You can either study ECON or MATH. 

You need to spend a minimum of 1 hour studying each ECON chapter and a minimum of 2 hours studying each MATH chapter. 

Draw a graph, with econ chapter on the x-axis and math chapter on the y-axis, to show your maximum daily productivity.

The Production Possibilities Frontier

The opportunity cost of something is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to get it.



Illustrating costs: Production Possibilities Frontier

PPF (or PPC) shows that maximum attainable combinations of two goods or services that can be produced with existing resources and best available technology.

Existing resources: a maximum of 16 hours each day

Best available technology: spend a minimum of 1 hour studying each ECON chapter and a minimum of 2 hours studying each MATH chapter. 



The Production Possibilities Frontier

 Your Production Schedule of 8 hours of work. Assume:

You either produce websites or computer programs

 Time is the only resource you need



What does the movement from D to B represent?



What does the movement from D to B represent?



Answer:

A movement along the PPF boundary involves a tradeoff. 

The slope represents opportunity cost.

Moving from point

D to B

Give up 4 programs 

Get 2 websites

The Production Possibilities Frontier

Opportunity Cost

Give up 1 website (-1)

to get 2 programs (+2)

So 1 program (+1)

“costs” ½ website (-1/2) 

Opportunity Cost

Give up 2 programs (-2) 

to get 1 websites (+1)

So 1 website (+1)

 “costs” 2 programs (-2)

Sign of slope (-)

Why is the PPF negative?

Tradeoff

Size of slope (-2)

What does the slope represent?

What does one program “cost” you?

What does one website “cost” you?

The Production Possibilities Frontier

PPF with increasing cost

Problem Sets

When production is efficient it is not possible to produce more of one good or service without producing less of something else.



Which production point(s) on the right graph achieves production efficiency?

G and I

Which production point(s) on the right graph is attainable but inefficient?

F

Which production point(s) on the right graph is NOT attainable?

H



The Production Possibilities Frontier

The boundary of PPF shows an agent’s ability of producing with existing resources and best available technology. The boundary doesn’t necessarily reveal the actual production.



On the PPF boundary: produce efficiently 

apply all the existing resources and best technology

Inside the PPF boundary: produce inefficiently

have some resources unused and/or fail to apply the best technology

Outside the PPF boundary: unattainable to produce





Assume that the U.S. can produce gun and butter with constant costs technology. The U.S. can product at most m units of gun, OR n units of butter.

Draw the PPF 

Show the new PPF if a better education system increases the productivity of all workers

Show the new PPF if a technology makes gun production more efficient

Show the new PPF if many workers migrate to Canada

*Show the new PPF if a financial crisis leads to widespread unemployment







Problem sets 

Assume that the U.S. can produce gun and butter with constant costs technology. The U.S. can product at most m units of gun, OR n units of butter.

Draw the PPFs

Show the new PPF if a better education system increases the productivity of all workers 

Shift the entire curve out

Show the new PPF if a technology makes gun production more efficient

Shift the curve out on the gun-axis only

Show the new PPF if many workers migrate to Canada

Shift the entire curve in

*Show the new PPF if a financial crisis leads to widespread unemployment

PPF stays unchanged, while the actual production point moves inward







Problem sets 

The Production Possibilities Frontier

Shift the PPF when the production possibilities are affected by the change in constraints:



change in technology 

change in labor productivity: by education, work training, better working environments, etc

change in resources

change in climate

more

Problem sets 

Mike and Olivia produce computer programs and web sites. Their PPFs (within one day) are shown on the right.



Who is able to produce more computer programs (within one day)?

Who is able to produce more web sites (within one day)?

*Assume Mike and Olivia each needs to consume some computer programs and web sites. Does Mike have any incentive to trade with Olivia?

Mike’s PPF























PPF

Trade

Absolute advantage: able to produce more within a certain period of time.



Comparative advantage: able to produce at a lower opportunity cost 

give up less

Problem sets 

What is the OC of Mike producing one computer program?

What is the OC of Mike producing one Web site?

What is the OC of Olivia producing one computer program?

What is the OC of Olivia producing one Web site?

Who has a comparative advantage in producing computer programs?

Who has a comparative advantage in producing websites?

Mike’s PPF























PPF

Problem sets 

What is the OC of Mike producing one computer program?

20/16 websites or 5/4 websites

What is the OC of Mike producing one Web site?

16/20 programs or 4/5 program

What is the OC of Olivia producing one computer program?

2 websites

What is the OC of Olivia producing one Web site?

½ programs

Who has a comparative advantage in producing computer programs?

Mike

Who has a comparative advantage in producing websites?

Olivia

Mike’s PPF























PPF

Trade

The terms of trade (TOT) is the negotiated exchange rate of goods for goods.





Problem sets 

Assume a TOT: 6 websites exchange for 4 programs.

If Olivia specializes in producing websites and accept this trade deal, is she better off?

If Mike specializes in producing computer programs and accept this trade deal, is he better off?



Mike’s PPF























PPF

Trade

Assume the simplest case: 

only two countries in the world

each produces two goods

both produce with constant cost technologies

have similar market sizes



Then:

If two countries have different opportunity cost, they will specialize in producing the product that they can produce at a lower opportunity cost, and then trade.

Both countries can be better off if the terms of trade (TOT) is fair.





Trade

Due to trade, the goods that we can buy and consume in a country are not limited by what the country can produce. 



Trade can make both countries consume outside their PPFs.



Trade

The goods and services that we buy from other countries are our imports; and the goods and services that we sell to people in other countries are our exports.



What Drives International Trade?

The fundamental force that generates trade between nations is comparative advantage (divergent opportunity costs between countries). 



The terms of trade is the negotiated exchange rate of goods for goods.

The principle of comparative advantage provides a range in which trade will occur and fair.

Each country has two options: trade, or not

If “trade”: opportunity of importing = x 

If “not trade”: has to produce by itself and the opportunity cost of producing = y

To make the country pick “trade” over “not trade”, we need x <= y

The opportunity cost of importing should be less or equal to its opportunity cost of producing.





You have a leaking roof.

fix it yourself: cost you $400 (including your money, time, energy, frustration, etc)

Hire a worker: cost you $x



If the worker asks for $x=$300, will you hire the worker?

If the worker asks for $y=$500, will you hire the worker?
