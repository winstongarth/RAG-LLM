Unemployment and Labor market

Chapter 9 

Unemployment

Unemployment might result in

 Lost incomes and production

 Lost human capital



The first monthly unemployment rate under President Trump increased from 4.7% to 4.8%

Was it a bad sign? 

Unemployment

Civilian noninstitutional population: persons 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, who are not inmates of institutions (e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces.

Also called civilian working-age population, or civilian potential workers.

The working-age population is divided into two groups:

People in the civilian labor force

People not in the civilian labor force

Unemployment

People in working-age population but not in labor force: 

Not available for work: e.g. full-time students.

Not want to work: e.g. homemakers.



To be counted as unemployed, a person must be in labor force and in one of the following three categories:

Without work but has made specific efforts to find a job within the previous four weeks

Waiting to be called back to a job from which he or she has been laid off

Waiting to start a new job within 30 days



Current Population Survey (CPS)

https://www.bls.gov/cps/

The statistics in this periodical are compiled from two major sources: (1) household interviews, and (2) reports from employers. 

Data based on household interviews are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), a sample survey of the population 16 years of age and over. The survey is conducted each month by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and provides comprehensive data on the labor force, the employed, and the unemployed, classified by such characteristics as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation, and industry attachment. The survey also provides data on the characteristics and past work experience of those not in the labor force. 

The information is collected by trained interviewers from a sample of about 60,000 households (beginning with July 2001 data) located in 754 sample areas. These areas are chosen to represent all counties and independent cities in the United States, with coverage in 50 States and the District of Columbia. The data collected are based on the activity or status reported for the calendar week including the 12th of the month.

In June 2014:

Population: 318 million

Working-age population: 248 million

Labor force: 156.0 million

Employed: 146.3 million

Unemployed: 9.7 million

Unemployment

Three Labor Market Indicators

The unemployment rate (U-3)

The employment-to-population ratio

The labor force participation rate









unemployment rate



employment to population ratio







labor force participation rate

Practice Question

Using the official measure of unemployment, which of the following people are considered unemployed?

Someone who choses not to work because of health concerns

No, not in labor force

People who have no jobs and give up looking for jobs as they were discouraged about their job prospects during the pandemic

No, not in labor force

A restaurant worker who was temporary laid off and expecting a recall

Yes



Practice Question

Population = 100

Non potential worker = 8

Labor force = 80

Number of employed persons = 70      



Based on the data for the country of Tiny Town

Calculate the unemployment rate.

Calculate the labor force participation rate.

Assume the economy is now in recession. 2 unemployed people, as a result, have given up looking for jobs. What are the new unemployment rate and labor force participation rate?



Practice Question









Unemployment

Discouraged worker effect describes the phenomena that the unemployment rate tends to understate the real situation in the bad time because some discouraged workers stop looking for jobs during the recession.

Marginally attached worker: persons marginally attached to the labor force are those who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months.

A subset of those not in the labor force 

A discouraged worker is a marginally attached worker who has stopped looking for a job because of repeated failure to find one.

 A subset of people marginally attached to the labor force

They are not classified as unemployed because they have not actively searched for work in the last 4 weeks.

Concepts and Definitions (CPS)

Practice Question

Are the following people unemployed? 

A HKU graduate who waits to start his new job soon.

Yes, frictional unemployment

Uber drivers who lost their jobs because technological innovation makes all Uber self-driving.

Yes, structural unemployment

Toll collector who lost their jobs permanently due to E‑ZPass (electronic toll collection system).

Yes, structural unemployment

A waitress who was laid off due to the pandemic and economic recession.

Yes, cyclical unemployment

Frictional unemployment

occurs when people take time to find a job

It is the short-term unemployment associated with the process of matching workers with jobs. 

E.g. workers quitting one job to find one that is a better fit for their skills or lifestyle; students who have just graduated from college and are looking for their first job.

Unemployment can be classified into three types:

Frictional unemployment: short-term unemployment that arises from the process of matching workers with jobs 

Increases in the number of people entering and reentering the labor force.

Frictional unemployment is a permanent and (generally) healthy phenomenon of a growing economy.

 Frictional unemployment always exists because there are always some workers in transition

Question: how would the increases in unemployment benefits affect frictional unemployment?

Depends on how the exact unemployment benefit is structured. 

It can raise the frictional unemployment.

Structural unemployment

Cyclical unemployment

Practice Question

If we assume that the individuals in question have been actively searching for hobs in the past four weeks, can we consider them as being unemployed?

Toll collectors who lost their jobs permanently due to electronic toll collection system (Autotoll, E‑Zpass, etc.)

Yes, structural unemployment

Uber drivers who lost their jobs because technological innovation makes all Uber self-driving.

Yes, structural unemployment

A seamstress who lost her job because many clothing manufacturers were moved to other countries with lower labor costs. 

Yes, structural unemployment



Structural unemployment

occurs because of a geographic or skill mismatch between workers and employers

Unemployment can be classified into three types:

Frictional unemployment

Structural unemployment is unemployment created by structural changes (e.g. changes in technology and foreign competition) that change the skills needed to perform jobs or the locations of jobs.

Jobs are available, but there is a serious mismatch between what companies need and what workers can offer.

Structural unemployment lasts longer than frictional unemployment.

Cyclical unemployment

Practice Question

Are the following people unemployed? 

A HKU graduate who waits to start his new job soon.

Yes, frictional unemployment

Uber drivers who lost their jobs because technological innovation makes all Uber self-driving.

Yes, structural unemployment

A waitress who was laid off due to the pandemic and economic recession, asssuming that she has been actively searching for jobs.

Yes, cyclical unemployment

Cyclical unemployment

associated with jobs lost due to recession

A business cycle is a periodic but irregular up-and-down movement of total production and other measures of economic activity. 



Every cycle has two phases:1. Expansion: is a period during which real GDP increases 2. Recession: is a period during which real GDP decreases



and two turning points:1. Peak: an expansion ends and recession begins at a business cycle peak, which is the highest level that real GDP has attained up to that time2. Trough: a recession ends at a through, when real GDP reaches a temporary low point and from which the next expansion begins.

Business Cycle

Unemployment

Ignore discouraged worker effect for this question. What do you expect the unemployment rate to be during the following situations:

A recession, when firms tend to fire workers.

An expansion, when firms tend to hire workers.

A “normal or natural period” when firms do neither.



The “normal” unemployment rate is the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) or noncyclical rate of unemployment.

often used as an unemployment benchmark

The unemployment caused by a business cycle (fluctuation) is cyclical unemployment







The “normal” unemployment rate 

Positive or negative

Rises during economic downturns and falls when the economy improves

Always positive





Unemployment can be classified into three types:

Frictional unemployment

Structural unemployment 

Cyclical unemployment

Defined as the unemployment caused by a business cycle (fluctuation)

Also defined as the deviation of the actual unemployment rate from its natural rate

For example, a worker who is laid off because the economy is in a recession and is then rehired when the expansion begins experiences cyclical unemployment.

FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=lOu

Rises during economic downturns and falls when the economy improves

Cyclical unemployment can turn into structural: not everyone who loses a job during a recession finds the same type of job after the recession. 

The first monthly unemployment rate under President Trump increased from 4.7% to 4.8%

Was it a bad sign? 

If unemployment rate and labor force participation rate both increase in the short term (during which the number of potential workers doesn’t change much) then it signals a growing economy.
