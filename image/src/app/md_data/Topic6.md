Aggregate Production

Chapter 10 & 8

Supplementary material: Charles Jones, Macroeconomics

Introduction

A model

A mathematical representation of a hypothetical world that we use to study economic phenomena

Consists of equations and unknowns with real-world interpretations

Vast oversimplifications of the real world in a model can still allow it to provide important insights.



Macroeconomists

Document facts

Build a model to understand the facts

Examine the model to see how effective it is





Production Model

Simplifying assumption:

Production factors:

Labor

Capital

Land

Entrepreneurship

Aggregate production function: shows how much real output of a country (Y) can be produced given the number of labor inputs (L) and capital inputs (K).

Human capital, or Labor

The stock of skills embodied in labor to produce output or economic value.

L is the number of workers used in production

Physical capital stock 

The stock of capital, which is manufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services.

Technology 

A set of devices and practices that determine how efficiently an economy uses its labor and capital.

Possessing superior knowledge in production or implementing more efficient production processes enables the production of increased output with the same labor and capital inputs.

The aggregate production function has the same two properties as the production function of an individual firm.

“More is better”

An increase in either physical capital or total efficiency units of labor, holding the other factor constant, leads to an increase in real output.

Law of diminishing marginal product

The aggregate production function has the same two properties as the production function of an individual firm.

“More is better”

Law of diminishing marginal product

Diminishing marginal product of labor (MPL): holding everything else (including A and K) constant, MPL will decrease eventually as more labor inputs are used for production.

Diminishing marginal product of capital (MPK): holding everything else (including A and H = h x L) constant, MPK will decrease eventually as more capital inputs are used for production.

What do firms do?

What do firms do?

A firm is an institution that hires factors of production and organizes them to produce and sell goods and services. 

A firm’s goal is to maximize economic profit, given the constraints it faces.



To maximize economics profit, a firm must make decisions including: 

What to produce and in what quantities

How to organize and compensate its managers and workers

How to market and price its products (if not in a perfectly competitive market)

What to produce itself and what to buy from other firms

Capital income

Labor income







Real output

Income = Production

The aggregate production function has the same two properties as the production function of an individual firm.

“More is better”

An increase in either physical capital or total efficiency units of labor, holding the other factor constant, leads to an increase in real output.

Law of diminishing marginal product

Diminishing marginal product of labor (MPL): holding everything else (including A and K) constant, MPL will decrease eventually as more labor inputs are used for production.

Diminishing marginal product of capital (MPK): holding everything else (including A and H = h x L) constant, MPK will decrease eventually as more capital inputs are used for production.



One unit of labor

Practice Question

Assuming everything else remains constant, can labor force growth lead to:

higher output 

better welfare for average people (assuming the income is evenly distributed)

sustained long-term economic growth



Yes (generally speaking)

No (generally speaking)

The labor supply curve shifts rightward.

The real wage rate falls and aggregate hours  increase.

An increase in labor supply increases real GDP.

"More" is not ALWAYS better

Practice Question

Assuming everything else remains constant, can the growth of physical capital stock alone lead to:

higher output 

better welfare for average people (assuming the income is evenly distributed)

sustained long-term economic growth



Yes (generally speaking)

Yes (generally speaking)

For a household

Income = consumption + saving



For a simplified economy

Production = income = consumption + saving

Consumption: consumption goods

Saving or investment: investment goods

Assuming everything else remains constant, can a higher saving rate lead to:

Higher output

better welfare for average people (assuming the income is evenly distributed)

Understanding TFP Differences

Human capital 

Technology

Advances in technology result from purposeful, optimizing decisions by entrepreneurs and firms.

Firms and the government in the United States spent 2.8% of GDP in R&D to find new ways of applying science to production methods and to develop new and improved goods and services.

Institutions

Misallocation 

Understanding TFP Differences

Human capital

Stock of skills that individuals accumulate to make them more productive

Education and training 

Returns to education

Value of the increase in wages from additional schooling

Richer countries may use more modern and efficient technologies than poor countries.

Increases productivity parameter



Understanding TFP Differences

Even if human capital and technologies are better in rich countries, why do they have these advantages?



Institutions are in place to foster human capital and technological growth.

Property rights

The rule of law

Government systems

Contract enforcement

Understanding TFP Differences

Misallocation

Resources not being put to their best use

The role of entrepreneurs here is critical, in pioneering new ways to bring together the factors of production to produce better or lower cost products.

Examples

Inefficiency of state-run resources

Political interference
