Chapter 1-2

Optimization

What is the benefit of getting college education? 

What is the cost of getting college education?

Optimization

Benefit of something is the gain or pleasure that it brings and is determined by preferences - by what a person likes and dislikes and the intensity of those feelings.

Cost is what you must give up to get something.



Optimization

Assume you are under a scholarship that all your tuition and school related expenses are paid by the university. Then your cost of spending four years getting the college education is ZERO.

Is it a true statement?



Optimization

Trade-offs arise when some benefits must be given up in order to gain others. 

An economic agent faces a trade-off, or exchange, when the agent needs to give up at least one thing to get something else.

All optimization problems involve trade-offs.





Pasta

Pizza

Sushi

Taco

Curry

Ramen

Assume the university will pay for your dinner tonight, limited to one entr√©e.

Which one would you order?

If your favorite dish is not available, what would you order then?

Optimization

The opportunity cost of something is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to get it.

Opportunity cost is the next best alternative

Example: the opportunity cost of increased funding for space exploration might be giving up the opportunity to fund cancer research.

ALWAYS consider opportunity cost when calculating cost.













Marginal analysis

Assume you want some oranges and will not consider any other food. Your benefit and cost of eating oranges are given in the table above. 

Will you eat the 4th orange?

Marginal analysis

Will you eat the 4th orange?

How many oranges will you eat?

Answer: 2 oranges













Marginal analysis

Marginal benefit (MB)is the additional benefit generated by moving from one feasible alternative to the next feasible alternative.



Marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost generated by moving from one feasible alternative to the next feasible alternative.

Marginal analysis

Optimization

If an option is the best choice, you will be made

better off, or at least not worse off, as you move toward it

worse off, or at least not better off, as you move away from it



Two Optimization Techniques

Marginal analysis 

Net benefit analysis (or total value analysis, or cost-benefit analysis)



Net benefit analysis

Net benefit = total benefit - total cost



Net benefit analysis:

Translate all costs and benefits into common units, for example dollars per month.

Calculate the net benefit of each alternative.

Pick the alternative with the highest net benefit.

Net benefit analysis

Assume you want some oranges and will not consider any other food. Your benefit and cost of eating oranges are given in the table above. 

Will you eat the 4th orange?

How many oranges will you eat?

Optimization

Two ways to optimize:

Marginal analysis

marginal benefit and marginal cost

Net benefit analysis

net benefit = total benefit - total cost



Two optimization techniques yield identical answers. You can use whichever technique you find easier for the particular problem.



Optimization application

You need to decide where to live for the new semester. You are considering four apartments. Assume these four apartments are identical besides the rent and distance to campus.



Very Close apartment, which is very close to campus.

Close apartment, which is close to campus.

Far apartment, which is far from campus.

Very Far apartment, which is very far from campus.



campus

Optimization application

Where should you live?

Trade-off: rent vs. distance

Optimization application

What does it cost to commute?



Bus/MTR fare

Gasoline/parking/wear and tear on car

Wear and tear on shoes

Opportunity cost of your time!!!



Optimization application

Assume the explicit cost of commuting is (USD) $5 per hour and your opportunity cost of time is $5 per hour. Where should you live?

Optimization application

Assume the explicit cost of commuting is $5 per hour and your opportunity cost of time is $5 per hour. Where should you live?

Optimization application

Assume the explicit cost of commuting is $5 per hour and your opportunity cost of time is $5 per hour. Where should you live?



Answer: Apt Far

Optimization application

Assume the explicit cost of commuting is $5 per hour and your opportunity cost of time is $15 per hour. Where should you live?

Optimization application

Assume the explicit cost of commuting is $5 per hour and your opportunity cost of time is $15 per hour. Where should you live?

Optimization application

Assume the explicit cost of commuting is $5 per hour and your opportunity cost of time is $15 per hour. Where should you live?



Answer: Apt Very close

Optimization application

Trade-off: rent and commuting

Pay higher rent to save the time spent on commuting, OR

Live further away from campus to save money
