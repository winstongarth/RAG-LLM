Question I. Production Model (30 points)
We are researching a certain country and we want to develop a baseline model to study its aggregate production. Before
we begin our study, we must select the appropriate aggregate production function. The two potential functions 𝑓 and 𝑓
! "
are:
! "
𝑓: 𝑌 =𝐴̅𝐾#𝐿#
!
𝑓 : 𝑌 =𝐴̅+𝐾+𝐿
"
We also assume that the quantity supplied of capital 𝐾 and the quantity supplied of labor 𝐿 are exogenous and constant,
$ $
such that
𝐾 =𝐾+
$
𝐿 =𝐿,
$
where
• 𝑌 is endogenous real output
• 𝐾 is endogenous capital stock
• 𝐿 is endogenous labor stock measured by the amount of workers
• 𝐴̅ is total factor productivity (TFP) and assumed to be exogenous and greater than one
• 𝐾+ and 𝐿, are positive constants
I-1. Which production function makes better sense? Provide a brief explanation in 1-3 sentences.
I-2. Using the appropriate aggregate production function, provide the formulas of 𝑀𝑃𝐾 and 𝑀𝑃𝐿. [Derivation not
required.]
I-3. Using the appropriate aggregate production function, state the general equilibrium conditions, which include the first
order conditions and market clearing conditions, along with their corresponding economic intuitions. [Derivation not
required.]
I-4. Using the appropriate aggregate production function, provide the equations for the variables in the general
equilibrium, including 𝐾∗, 𝐿∗, 𝑌∗, equilibrium relative price of labor (in output) 𝑤∗ and equilibrium relative price of
capital (in output)
𝑟∗
. [Derivation not required.]
I-5. Denote the per-worker capital stock by 𝑘 =𝐾/𝐿. Provide the equation for per-worker output in the equilibrium 𝑦∗.
[Derivation not required.]
I-6. Use EconGraphs (link) and draw a 3D production function showing the relationship of 𝑌 , 𝐾 and 𝐿 when 𝐴̅ =1.
I-7. If 𝐴̅ increases to 10 while holding everything else constant, how would the graph in (I-6) change and what would be the
impact on production and the economy? Explain [you can use 1-3 sentences, graphs, or equations as needed].
I-8. Explain [you can use 1-3 sentences, graphs, or equations as needed] whether or not each of the factors below can
contribute to the sustained long term economic growth.
• A larger labor force.
• Capital stock accumulation.
• A permanently higher saving rate.
• A permanently better TFP.

Question III. Private Investment: A FRED Question (15 points)
Search the FRED database for the "investment share of GDP" and one of the first links to appear is for "gross private
domestic investment."
III-1. Display a graph of this series from 2003-1-1 to 2023-1-1.
!
III-2. How does its average value compare to the ratio of capital income to output learnt in class (𝑟⋅𝐾 = 𝑌)? Explain.
#
III-3. There should be two significant drop-offs in the graph of question (III-1). Provide a brief explanation for each of the
significant drop-offs observed, discussing the potential reasons behind each of them.
Question IV. Fiscal Multiplier (15 points)
Suppose households on average save 25 cents out of every dollar they earn after tax, while a proportional tax rate 𝜏 =20%
is applied uniformly to all households, regardless of their income level. Assume that investment, government purchases,
and net exports are all autonomous expenditures.
IV-1. Find the value of the fiscal multiplier.
IV-2. Calculate the expected overall impact on GDP if the government decides to increase its purchases by $10 trillion
dollars.
IV-3. Suppose the economy is in a recession and the government has been taking actions to stimulate economic activity.
Explain whether or not you would recommend the government to implement policies that encourage household
saving.
Question V. Unemployment: A FRED Question (20 points)
V-1. Search the FRED database for the "Unemployment Rate". Display a graph of this series from 1949-01-01 to 2023-10-01.
V-2. Search the FRED database for the "Noncyclical Rate of Unemployment". Display a graph of this series from 1949-01-01
to 2025-10-01.
V-3. Disregarding variations in data frequency, compare the graphs of "Unemployment Rate" and "Noncyclical Rate of
Unemployment". Without countercyclical policies, analyze [you can use 1-3 sentences, graphs, or equations as needed]
the short-run relationship between the difference (𝑢−𝑁𝐴𝐼𝑅𝑈), output, and inflation in various stages of the business
cycle. [Hints: Okun’s law and Phillips curve.]
V-4. Without policy interventions, analyze [you can use 1-3 sentences, graphs, or equations as needed] the long-run
relationship between the 𝑁𝐴𝐼𝑅𝑈, output, and inflation. [Hint: Long-run Phillips curve.]
