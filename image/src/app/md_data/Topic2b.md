GDP

Chapter 8

Consider an economy that produces 2 goods: canned soup and basketball. Assume their qualities are constant over time.

Calculate GDP2010  and GDP2020?

GDP2010 = 50x$10+100x$20=$2,500

GDP2020 = 50x$20+100x$40=$5,000

“GDP2020>GDP2010, therefore the economy has been growing.” Do you agree with this statement?

No



Real GDP

GDP Is the value of final goods and services evaluated at the current-year prices.

Nominal GDP is just a more precise name for GDP.





Real GDP is the value of final goods and services evaluated at the base-year prices.















Consider an economy that produces 2 goods: canned soup (s) and basketballs (b).

Select 2010 to be the base year. Calculate RGDP2010 and RGDP2020.

RGDP2010 = Qs,2010 x Ps,base + Qb,2010 x Pb,base 

= 50x$10+100x$20 = 2,500 (2010 dollar)

RGDP2020 = Qs,2020 x Ps,base + Qb,2020 x Pb,base 

= 50x$10+100x$20 = 2,500 (2010 dollar)

“RGDP2020 = RGDP2010, therefore the economy has NOT been growing.” Do you agree with this statement?

Yes

Which one is a better index for measuring economic growth, nominal GDP or real GDP?

Real GDP

Real GDP hold the prices constant:

Eliminate price level change and focus on productions.

Better for measuring economic growth

Real GDP can be “different” if use different base price

Real GDP

Consider an economy that produces 2 goods: canned soup (s) and basketballs (b).

Use 2010 as the base year. Calculate RGDP2010 and RGDP2020.

RGDP2010 = Qs,2010 x Ps,base + Qb,2010 x Pb,base 

= 50x$10+100x$20 = 2,500 (2010 dollar)

RGDP2020 = Qs,2020 x Ps,base + Qb,2020 x Pb,base 

= 50x$10+100x$20 = 2,500 (2010 dollar)

Use 2020 as the base year. Calculate RGDP2010 and RGDP2020.

RGDP2010 = Qs,2010 x Ps,base + Qb,2010 x Pb,base 

= 50x$20+100x$40 = 5,000 (2020 dollar)

RGDP2020 = Qs,2020 x Ps,base + Qb,2020 x Pb,base 

= 50x$20+100x$40 = 5,000 (2020 dollar)









Measuring Economic Growth





Practice Question

Practice Question

Measuring Economic Growth



Accurate

Compare the standard of living across cities

Assume HK island has income per capita: US$6,000

Assume Bangkok has income per capita: US$4,000

Practice Question

HK island: income per capita = $6,000

Bangkok: income per capita = $4,000

Assume that the cost of living in HK island is twice as much as the cost of living in Bangkok. Ignore how income is distributed. 

Which city has a better living standard?





To compare the standard of living across countries, need to consider:

Nominal exchange rates (exchange rate between currencies)

Differences in cost of living



The good and services in both countries must be valued at the same prices 

apply purchasing power parity (PPP) price

Convert a country’s GDP by using the prices of goods and services in the country relative to the prices of the same goods and services in the other country.

Question: In what way does the comparison between GDP in China and GDP in Saudi Arabia reflect the difference in their respective standards of living?

PPP

China in 2015

GDP = 60,001 billion yuan

Total population = 1,373 million people

GDP per capita = 43,686 yuan per person



Saudi Arabia in 2015

GDP = 2,521 billion riyal

Total population = 31.38 million people

GDP per capita = 80,317 riyal per person

PPP

Question: How do we make GDP comparisons between China and Saudi Arabia to reflect the difference in their respective standards of living??

There are two main methods used to convert the GDP of different countries into a single currency:

Method #1: Exchange-rate-based measure

Method #2: Purchasing Power Parity measure (PPP)

PPP



Problematic



Better

Method #1: Exchange-rate-based measure

Convert GDP in China and Saudi Arabia into U.S. dollars, using current exchange rates:

GDP per capita in U.S. dollars  = GDP per capita in local currency × $ / local currency exchange rate

For example:

GDP per capital in China in U.S. dollars = GDP per capita in China in yuan ($/yuan)

PPP

China GDP per capita in 2015 

Using Exchange Rates

GDP per capita in China in $ = China GDP per capita in yuan × $ / yuan exchange rate

GDP per capita in China in $ = 43,686 yuan × 0.161  = $7,033



Saudi Arabia (S.A.) GDP in 2015 

Using Exchange Rates

GDP per capita in S.A. in $ = S.A. GDP per person in riyal × $ / riyal exchange rate

GDP per capita in S.A. in $ = 80,317 riyal  × 0.267 = $21,445

PPP





There are two problems with using exchange rates to compare GDP across countries:

Prices of goods and services can vary across economies.

Exchange rates fluctuate throughout the year due to reasons beyond price changes.

PPP

PPP

Using the exchange rate to compare GDP in one country with GDP in another country is problematic because …

prices of particular products in one country may be much less or much more than in the other country.

Using the market exchange rate to value China’s GDP in U.S. dollars leads to an estimate that in 2013, GDP per person in the United States was 7.9 times  GDP per person in China.

When GDP is valued at purchasing power parity prices, U.S. income per person is only 5.6 times that in China.

Method #2: purchasing  power parity-based (PPP)

Convert a country’s GDP by using the prices of goods and services in the country relative to the prices of the same goods and services in the other country.

To convert the GDP per capita of different countries using the PPP-based method, we 

select a representative bundle of commodities, and 

calculate the cost of the bundle in each country

“In practice, however, absolute PPP does not hold for a number of reasons, and these undermine its usefulness as a theory of the determination of the level of the exchange rate…”

Even though PPP adjustments raise the income levels of the developing countries, there are still very large disparities in income per capita across countries.
