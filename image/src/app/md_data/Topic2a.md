GDP



How to measure the total production of a country?

National income accounts: measure the level of aggregate economic activity in a country.

National income and product accounts (NIPAs): the system of national income accounts used by the U.S. government.

Three different ways to measure aggregate economic activity in a country 

Production

Expenditure

Income

In our intro level class, we ignore the minor differences and simply have:

Production or aggregate production: the number of goods and services produced in the economy during a given period of time.



Expenditure or aggregate expenditure: the total purchases in the economy during a given period of time.

represents the payments for goods and services.



Income or aggregate income: all the income earned in the economy during a given period of time.

represents the payments that are made from firms to households for the use of their production factors

The production approach

GDP

GDP or gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a period of time, typically one year.

GDP is measured using market value (not quantity)

GDP ‚Äúincludes only‚Äù the market value of final goods, which has already included the market value of intermediate goods 

A final good or service is an item bought by its final user

GDP includes only goods and services that are produced within a country.

GDP includes only current production (production in a given time period, normally a year) 

no used goods

Case #2: a pizza oven is bought by an Italian restaurant and used to make pizza for their customers

The pizza oven is an intermediate good

The pizza is a final good

The value of pizza oven is included in the value of pizzas

Case #1: a pizza oven is bought by a family for family use

This pizza oven is a final good



Practice Questions

Suppose there is a very simple economy, says A, produces only four goods and services: massage, pizzas, textbooks and paper. Assume all the paper in this economy is used for the production of textbooks. Use the information below to compute the (nominal) GDP2022

Value of massage in 2022 = Q x P2022 = 20 x $50 = $1,000

Value of textbook in 2022= Q x P2022 = 150 x $40 = $6,000

Value of pizza in 2022 = Q x P2022 = 1,000 x $2 = $2,000

GDP2022 = $1,000 + $6,000 + $2,000 = $9,000

Value of massage in 2022 = Q x P2022 = 20 x $50 = $1,000

Value of paper in 2022 = Q x P2022 = 20,000 x $0.05 = $1,000

Value of textbook net of paper in 2022= 150 x $40 - $1,000 = $5,000

Value of pizza in 2022 = Q x P2022 = 1,000 x $2 = $2,000

GDP2022 = $1,000 + $1,000 + $5,000 + $2,000 = $9,000





A U.S. consumer pays $1000 to a BestBuy store for a Dell laptop.

American producers has contributed to U.S. GDP = ?

That BestBuy store pays $900 for that laptop from Dell Company.

The value added in this case of BestBuy =?

$1000 - $900 = $100

Dell pays a foreign manufacturer $600 for that laptop.

The value added in this case of Dell = ?

$900 - $600 = $300

The value added in this case of American producers = ?

value added of BestBuy + value added by Dell = $100 + $300 = $400

American producers has contributed to U.S. GDP = ?

$400





GDP

Aggregate economic activity in a country can be measured by:



The production approach

Production-based accounts measure and aggregate each firm‚Äôs value added

Statistics Canada¬†"For each industry, this involves first determining its output and then subtracting the goods and services that were used up in the process of generating that output. The goods and services that are used up are referred to as intermediate consumption (or simply inputs). The difference between an industry‚Äôs output and its intermediate consumption is its gross value added."

Practice Questions

Starbucks purchases its intermediate goods (such as coffee beans, paper cups, lids, holders, etc.) for $0.25 per cup and sells coffee to customers for $2.00 per cup. 

How much is the value added per cup of coffee by Starbucks? 

$2-$0.25=$1.75

Assume that Starbucks produces 10B cups of coffee in the U.S. It sells 8B cups in U.S. and 2B cups to the rest of the world in the year of 2022. How much is the value added of Starbucks in the year of 2022? 

$1.75 x 10B=$17.5B

How much is the value that Starbucks has contributed to the U.S. GDP2022. 

$17.5B







GDP

Measure expenditure

Expenditure or aggregate expenditure: the total purchases in the economy during a given period of time.

represents the payments for goods and services.

The expenditure approach



Who are paying for Microsoft Office?

ùëå = aggregate expenditure 

aggregate expenditure = aggregate income= aggregate production (GDP)

ÔÉ® ùëå = GDP

ùê∂ = consumption

ùêº = investment

ùê∫ = government purchases

ùëÅùëã = net exports

= ùëã ‚àí ùëÄ

= Exports ‚Äì Imports



National income accounting identity

Consumption (Personal Consumption Expenditures)

C

spending by households on goods and services, not including spending on new houses

 Investment (Gross private domestic investment)

I

Spending by firms on new factories, office buildings, machinery, and additions to inventories, plus spending by households and firms on new houses 

IPP added in 2013: link

Government purchases (Government consumption expenditures and gross investment)

G

Spending on goods and services and investment by federal, state, and local governments.

This does not include transfer payments or corporate subsidies



Transfer payments are¬†payments made by governments through social programs to individuals. 

Unlike common payment, there is no reception of goods and services in return.

E.g., unemployment insurance benefits, food stamp

Net export

NX= export ‚Äì import = X - M

exports minus imports

Expenditure approach: measures GDP as the sum of consumption expenditure, investment, government expenditure on goods and services, and net exports. 

Y = C + I + G + (X - M)

National income accounts

Measure income

The income approach



The income approach measures GDP by summing the incomes that firms pay households for the factors of production they hire

Include: wages for labor, interest for capital, rent for land, and profit for entrepreneurship. 

Compensation of employees is the payment for labor services. It includes net wages and salaries that workers receive plus taxes withheld on earnings plus fringe benefits such as social security and pension fund distribution.

Net interest, rental income, corporate profits, and proprietors‚Äô income are earned by capital and land.

In the United States, labor receives about two-thirds of total income, and capital receives about one-third of total income.

What isn‚Äôt measured by GDP?

GDP and national income accounting is a useful  system for taking the temperature of the economy. However, it is not perfect, and it necessarily leaves out a lot of details.



GDP does not include 

Household production

GDP does not include 

Depreciation of the physical capital stock and resources.

GDP does not include 

Some factors that negatively affect welfare, such as pollution, noise, and crime.

Some factors that positively affect welfare such as leisure time

Article: Italy's GDP includes cocaine, prostitution and black market link

GDP doesn‚Äôt include

Underground economy

GDPU.S. does not include 

Production by U.S. workers and U.S. capital abroad. 

GDP: production in the U.S. regardless of whose labor and capital (domestic or foreign) is used. 

GNP (gross national product) or GNI: production of domestically owned labor and capital in the U.S. and abroad. 

FRED: link

What is the difference between GDP and GNP in the U.S.?

GDPU.S. : records production in the U.S. regardless of whose labor and capital (domestic or foreign) is used. 

GNPU.S. : records production of domestically owned labor and capital in the U.S. and abroad.

GDP doesn‚Äôt include

Production per person

GDP (nominal)

GDP (nominal) per capita

Considering all these limitations, is GDP a poor measure of well-being of an economy?

Government Purchase

Government consumption expenditures consists of spending by government to produce and provide services to the public, such as national defense and public school education.

Government gross investment consists of spending by government for fixed assets that directly benefit the public, such as highway construction, or that assist government agencies in their production activities, such as purchases of military hardware.
